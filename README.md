# awc-helper-client

This project aims to provide a way to find anime for the [Anime Watching Challenge](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=2138549).

Hosted [here](https://nyomdalee.github.io/awc-helper-client/) on github pages.

Alternatively you can check out [awc-helper-txt](https://github.com/Nyomdalee/awc-helper-txt) for pre-generated lists.

It is my first time using Blazor (and ASP.NET, for that matter) so the code is undoubtedly jank.

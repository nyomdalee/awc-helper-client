Advancements in science and technology have led to the colonization of the moon, the commercialization of outer space, and the formation of large space corporations. Ai Tanabe, an upbeat woman whose interests lie in the cosmos, joins Technora Corporation as a member of their Debris Section, a department dedicated to the removal of dangerous space junk between the orbits of the Earth and Moon.\n\nHowever, Ai soon discovers how unappreciated her job is. As the laughingstock of Technora, the Debris Section is severely understaffed, poorly funded, and is forced to use a dilapidated spaceship nicknamed the \u0022Toy Box\u0022 for debris retrieval. Undeterred, Ai perseveres and gradually becomes acquainted with the strange personalities that make up the Debris Section\u0027s staff, such as the bumbling but good-natured chief clerk Philippe Myers; the mysterious and tight-lipped temp worker Edelgard Rivera; and the hotheaded and passionate Hachirouta Hoshino, who longs for a spaceship to call his own.\n\nPlanetes is an unconventional sci-fi series that portrays the vastness of space as a backdrop for the personal lives of ordinary people\u2014people who may have been born on Earth, but whose hopes and dreams lie amongst the stars.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.26,"Rank":292,"Popularity":940,"Genres":[{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":29,"Name":"Space"},{"Id":48,"Name":"Workplace"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2003,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"08:05"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":14646,"Completed":84578,"OnHold":10763,"Dropped":7641,"PlanToWatch":132581,"Total":250209},"Favorites":3942,"Producers":["Bandai Visual","NHK"],"Licensors":["Bandai Entertainment"],"Studios":["Sunrise"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Dive in the Sky\u0022 by Mikio Sakai"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Wonderful Life\u0022 by Mikio Sakai (eps 1-25)","2: \u0022PLANETES ~Affettuosso~\u0022 by Hitomi Kuroishi (eps 26)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=895","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T15:57:26.921+01:00"},{"Id":330,"Title":"Midori no Hibi","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/56961.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2004,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"2004-04-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2004,"Month":6,"Day":27,"Full":"2004-06-27"},"Synopsis":"There isn\u0027t a single person in Sakuradamon High who hasn\u0027t heard the legends about Seiji \u0022The Mad Dog\u0022 Sawamura\u0027s demonically powerful right hand.

The only characteristic he has to go by is that the murderer has a claw for an arm, hence the murderer being referred to as The Claw Man. During his travels, Van happens to pass through the city of Evergreen, which is defending itself from bandits who aim to rob the city of its treasury. It is in this city that Van meets Wendy Garret, a timid young girl who is looking for her kidnapped brother. When the city pleads for Van\u0027s assistance to defend it, he refuses, claiming it has nothing to do with him and thus leaves the city on its own to deal with the peril. Soon after, Van comes across the raiding bandits himself and they eventually tick off the swordsman to a degree where he takes action against them for his own personal vendetta. Surprisingly, Van learns that the bandits had ties with The Claw Man, and in kidnapping Wendy\u0027s brother for a reason they did not disclose. After the bandits are dealt with easily, Van and, much to his chagrin, Wendy continue the journey in search of The Claw Man. Little do they know, however, that The Claw Man is involved with something more atrocious than either could fathom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.26,"Rank":2849,"Popularity":2375,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2005,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":3928,"Completed":40550,"OnHold":3920,"Dropped":4111,"PlanToWatch":24921,"Total":77430},"Favorites":358,"Producers":["Studio Tulip"],"Licensors":["Funimation","Geneon Entertainment USA"],"Studios":["AIC ASTA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022GUNXSWORD\u0022 by Kotaro Nakagawa"],"Endings":["1: \u0022A Rising Tide\u0022 by Shuntaro Okino (eps 1-8,10,12-16,18-21,23,25)","2: \u0022Paradiso\u0022 by Hitomi (eps 9,11)","3: \u0022S.O.S\u0022 by Kikuko Inoue, Houko Kuwashima, Satsuki Yukino \u0026 Saeko Chiba (eps 17)","4: \u0022A Rising Tide (Accoustic Version)\u0022 by Shuntaro Okino (eps 22)","5: \u0022Calling You\u0022 by Shuntaro Okino (Ep 24)","6: \u0022GUNXSWORD (Starting Again)\u0022 by Kotaro Nakagawa and Ondekoza (eps 26)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=2839","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T15:59:27.003+01:00"},{"Id":412,"Title":"Kore ga Watashi no Goshujinsama","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/80500.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2005,"Month":4,"Day":8,"Full":"2005-04-08"},"EndDate":{"Year":2005,"Month":7,"Day":1,"Full":"2005-07-01"},"Synopsis":"Izumi Sawatari and her younger sister, Mitsuki Sawatari, have run away from home and are in need of employment.

Human life as we know it is almost extinct, and only a few were able to pull through the collapse of Earth\u0027s ecosystem. In order to deal with the chaos, a city named Ecoban was created. The city uses the very pollution that caused the disaster as an energy source.\n\nHowever, although the initial plan was successful to an extent, it didn\u0027t just create a new source of energy, but also an elite group of people. This prestigious faction believes that they are above the system, and are not willing to accept survivors from outside the city unless they are put to work as laborers.\n\nAmong the people living in the wasteland outside Ecoban is a young man named Shua. He leads a very difficult life, but tries to make the most of it through the love that he feels for his childhood friend Jay. Unfortunately, Jay may be more interested in her security commander Cade than in Shua, and thus a love triangle is formed. Not only does Shua have to deal with the heartbreak, but he must also find a new way to survive in the crumbles left from the once-beautiful planet Earth.","Mean":6.98,"Rank":4204,"Popularity":3673,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":64,"Name":"Love Polygon"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2003,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":5705,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":840,"Completed":20019,"OnHold":377,"Dropped":414,"PlanToWatch":13307,"Total":34957},"Favorites":74,"Producers":["Tin House"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Mar\u0027s Theme\u0022 by Pretty Children"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=1022","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T16:02:40.504+01:00"},{"Id":550,"Title":"Yu\u2606Gi\u2606Oh!","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/47487.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"1998-04-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":10,"Day":10,"Full":"1998-10-10"},"Synopsis":"Bullies often target someone frail and weak\u2014someone exactly like Yuugi Mutou.

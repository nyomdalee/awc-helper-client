One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act, so the men dose him with an experimental drug formulated by their criminal organization, leaving him to his death. However, to his own astonishment, Shinichi lives to see another day, but now in the body of a seven-year-old child.\n\nPerfectly preserving his original intelligence, he hides his real identity from everyone, including his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, private detective Kogorou Mouri. To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa.\n\nShinichi, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri\u0027s cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug\u0027s effects

But 11 years after a catastrophe dubbed the Holy Genesis brought ruin to the Earth, the Shadow Angels were stirred from their slumber and resumed the attacks once more.\n\nTo give humanity somewhat of a chance, an organization known as DEAVA was formed, and use of a robotic weapon named Aquarion has been authorized. In order for the Aquarion to be brought to full power, three pilots must combine their hearts, bodies, and souls into one\u2014a feat few can hope to accomplish. Thus, the search for so-called \u0027Element Users\u0027 was prioritised, hoping to ensure humanity\u0027s future.\n\nSousei no Aquarion follows the story of Apollo, a near-feral young man brought up in poverty, who is believed to be a legendary hero reincarnated. After his best friend is taken by the Shadow Angels, Apollo chooses to become an Aquarion pilot. Will he be able to turn the tides of the war, and free humanity from the threat of the Shadow Angels for once and for all?","Mean":7.08,"Rank":3986,"Popularity":2536,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"},{"Id":31,"Name":"Super Power"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2005,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Unknown","StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":3887,"Completed":42557,"OnHold":2846,"Dropped":3937,"PlanToWatch":26124,"Total":79351},"Favorites":360,"Producers":["Media Factory","Bandai","Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","Hakuhodo DY Media Partners"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Satelight"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Sousei no Aquarion\u0022 by AKINO (eps 2-17)","2: \u0022Go Tight\u0022 by AKINO (eps 18-25)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Omna Magni\u0022 by Yui Makino (eps 2-13, 15-24)","2: \u0022Kouya No Heath\u0022 by AKINO (eps 14)","3: \u0022Celiane\u0022 by Gabriela Robin (eps 25)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=2830","LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T03:05:17.044+01:00"},{"Id":479,"Title":"Ueki no Housoku","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1250/90876.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2005,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"2005-04-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":3,"Day":27,"Full":"2006-03-27"},"Synopsis":"Unbeknownst to most humans, a bizarre tournament is held to decide the next ruler of the Heavenly World.

Captain Herlock has defied this insipid mentality, leading a group of like-minded rebels to a more adventurous life aboard the spaceship Arcadia.\n \nA mysterious force known as the Mazone has invaded the Earth, taking the form of mysterious cloaked women that kill anyone who suspect their nefarious doings, such as Tadashi Daiba who is now on their hit-list. After his scientist father is ignored by the government and killed by the Mazone, he joins Captain Herlock and his ragtag group of pirates to assist them as they try to save humanity from the impending alien threat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.68,"Rank":1343,"Popularity":3714,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":29,"Name":"Space"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":42,"StartSeason":{"Year":1978,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"19:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":2742,"Completed":13498,"OnHold":2344,"Dropped":1504,"PlanToWatch":19840,"Total":39928},"Favorites":344,"Producers":["TV Asahi","Toei Advertising"],"Licensors":["Discotek Media","Harmony Gold"],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Captain Harlock (\u30AD\u30E3\u30D7\u30C6\u30F3\u30CF\u30FC\u30ED\u30C3\u30AF)\u0022 by Ichirou Mizuki"],"Endings":["\u0022Warera no Tabidachi (\u308F\u308C\u3089\u306E\u65C5\u7ACB\u3061)\u0022 by Ichirou Mizuki"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=725","LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T03:24:24.876+01:00"},{"Id":188,"Title":"Gosenzo Sane","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/78241.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":9,"Day":25,"Full":"1998-09-25"},"EndDate":{"Year":1999,"Month":3,"Day":25,"Full":"1999-03-25"},"Synopsis":"Masquerade is the story surrounding the Hiraga bloodline in which Gen is a part of.

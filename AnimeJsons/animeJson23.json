Reserved college student Ken Kaneki buries his nose in books and avoids the news of the growing crisis. However, the appearance of an attractive woman named Rize Kamishiro shatters his solitude when she forwardly asks him on a date.\n\nWhile walking Rize home, Kaneki discovers she isn\u0027t as kind as she first appeared, and she has led him on with sinister intent. After a tragic struggle, he later awakens in a hospital to learn his life was saved by transplanting the now deceased Rize\u0027s organs into his own body.\n\nKaneki\u0027s body begins to change in horrifying ways, and he transforms into a human-ghoul hybrid. As he embarks on his new dreadful journey, Kaneki clings to his humanity in the evolving bloody conflict between society\u0027s new monsters and the government agents who hunt them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.79,"Rank":1048,"Popularity":10,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":14,"Name":"Horror"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":58,"Name":"Gore"},{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"},{"Id":82,"Name":"Urban Fantasy"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":110676,"Completed":2454842,"OnHold":37059,"Dropped":60839,"PlanToWatch":237798,"Total":2901214},"Favorites":50982,"Producers":["Marvelous AQL","TC Entertainment","Shueisha"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Pierrot"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022unravel\u0022 by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure (eps 2-11)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022unravel\u0022 by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure (eps 1, 12)","2: \u0022Seijatachi (\u8056\u8005\u305F\u3061)\u0022 by People In The Box (eps 2-11)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10401","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T03:36:31.616+01:00"},{"Id":22325,"Title":"Ningen Kakumei","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/58465.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1995,"Month":1,"Day":null,"Full":"1995-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":2004,"Month":11,"Day":null,"Full":"2004-11"},"Synopsis":"Based on the saga novel \u0022The Human Revolution\u0022 by Daisuke Ikeda published in 1974-1999.","Mean":null,"Rank":17905,"Popularity":17076,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":20,"StartSeason":{"Year":1995,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1800,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":41,"Completed":85,"OnHold":18,"Dropped":63,"PlanToWatch":270,"Total":477},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Shinano Kikaku"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=7534","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T03:36:35.461+01:00"},{"Id":22327,"Title":"Himalaya no Hikari no Oukoku","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/58469.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1999,"Month":7,"Day":10,"Full":"1999-07-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":1999,"Month":7,"Day":10,"Full":"1999-07-10"},"Synopsis":"In a small village overlooking the scenic Himalayas, a young boy, Suruya, receives a letter from a princess.

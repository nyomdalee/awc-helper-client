An angler fish came there. The moon explained why he fell into the sea, but the angler fish did not hear the story because he was absorbed in fishing. Eating a fish, he went away. A shark came next. He tried to take the moon to the sky, but he got too tired partway and left the moon. Crabs came. They carried the moon to the beach, because they needed the light of a full moon to lay their eggs. When they finished laying their eggs, they went home. The moon left alone on the beach was washed away by the waves and returned into the sea. The moon rolled down a hill and fell on a turtle. It was a very old turtle who should know a lot. The moon asked him how to go back to the sky. The turtle asked a ray in the sand to take the moon with him. The ray took the moon with him and dropped the moon in the deepest sea. The moon sank deeper and deeper. There was a big fish in the bottom of the sea. Wrapped in particles of light coming out from the mouth of the big fish, the moon emerged on the surface of the sea and melted.\n\nDid the moon return to the sky? This animation can be interpreted differently by different viewers. It can be interpreted, for example, as a story of the moon that fell into the sea whether in reality or in a dream, or as a story of an old moon that had to die for the birth of a new moon, or as a story of a soul heading for heaven. Whatever interpretation viewers make, the story conveys a positive message that we are all allowed to exist. Represented by this animation is a small world gently embracing us all -- transient existence...\n\n(Source: YouTube)","Mean":6.17,"Rank":8942,"Popularity":14384,"Genres":[{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1123,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":28,"Completed":617,"OnHold":10,"Dropped":60,"PlanToWatch":218,"Total":933},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-06T00:34:00.132+01:00"},{"Id":30868,"Title":"Ajin Part 1: Shoudou","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1038/112814.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":11,"Day":27,"Full":"2015-11-27"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":11,"Day":27,"Full":"2015-11-27"},"Synopsis":"For high schooler Kei\u2014and for at least forty-six others\u2014immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever.\n\nSadly for Kei, such a feat doesn\u0027t make him a superhero.

the midst of Shouwa era Japan, greed runs rampant through the bustling cities and communities of the nation. King of Hell Enma Daiou summons an envoy into his office in the form of a small boy named Kurayami Santa. Through Enma\u0027s debriefing, Santa learns that the amount of greed and selfish behavior produced by humans will soon create an enormous wave of souls entering into Hell simultaneously, which would be catastrophic for Hell itself. \n\nSanta is given one mission: do something about it. With neither guidelines nor rules, Santa is tasked to handle the situation as he sees fit. In the human world, a rampaging thunderstorm strikes a nearby cemetery with a bolt of lightning, and the envoy of Hell appears. \n\nTeleported into the human world, Santa quickly realizes that humans are just as wicked as Enma had described. Without upsetting the balance between light and dark, Santa begins his quest to complete the mission from Hell and restore order to the human world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":5.16,"Rank":12868,"Popularity":10439,"Genres":[{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:42"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":180,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":170,"Completed":1381,"OnHold":138,"Dropped":387,"PlanToWatch":935,"Total":3011},"Favorites":5,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["ILCA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Kurayami Santa no Uta (\u6697\u95C7\u4E09\u592A\u306E\u3046\u305F)\u0022 by Yasuhiko Fukuda"],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=11283","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T05:04:03.6+01:00"},{"Id":30948,"Title":"Kowabon","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1695/112630.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":10,"Day":4,"Full":"2015-10-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":12,"Day":27,"Full":"2015-12-27"},"Synopsis":"In today\u0027s world full of wondrous technological innovation, the unnatural and mysterious sometimes appear even more horrifying than usual.

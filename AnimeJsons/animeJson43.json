A sudden news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang\u0027s cruel murder of the only girlfriend he ever had alongside her brother only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for good, Takemichi flashes back to that same day 12 years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.\n\nAfter being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata\u0027s younger brother. Without thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past. Takemichi urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he is not dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter the flow of time. Given the chance to prevent his ex-girlfriend\u0027s tragic death at the hands of the Tokyo Manji Gang, Takemichi decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.88,"Rank":852,"Popularity":105,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":55,"Name":"Delinquents"},{"Id":78,"Name":"Time Travel"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"02:08"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1421,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":201645,"Completed":792487,"OnHold":41104,"Dropped":66521,"PlanToWatch":210070,"Total":1311827},"Favorites":25267,"Producers":["Mainichi Broadcasting System","Pony Canyon","Kodansha","AT-X","Ultra Super Pictures","Studio Mausu","Sammy"],"Licensors":["VIZ Media"],"Studios":["LIDENFILMS"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Cry Baby\u0022 by Official HiGE DANdism"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Koko de Iki wo shite (\u3053\u3053\u3067\u606F\u3092\u3057\u3066)\u0022 by eill (eps 1-12)","2: \u0022Tokyo Wonder.

Considered a legend in the world of pottery, Himeno\u0027s mother suddenly passed away when Himeno was four. However, her legacy lives on in the dozens of unique mugs that adorn the Toyokawas\u0027 new restaurant in Tajimi.\n\nHaving moved back to the city recently following the bankruptcy of her father\u0027s company in Tokyo, Himeno brings some of her mother\u0027s mugs to her first day of high school in an attempt to make friends. One person who immediately takes an interest is Mika Kukuri, an eccentric girl in Himeno\u0027s class who soon introduces her to Tooko Aoki, the president of the Pottery Club. After learning more about her mother\u0027s contributions to the club and the art form, Himeno asks her father for permission to join, which he gladly gives.\n\nAlongside Mika and her childhood friend Naoko Naruse, Himeno enters the Pottery Club to continue her mother\u0027s beloved work and discover her own passion for the craft.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.54,"Rank":6815,"Popularity":3330,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":52,"Name":"CGDCT"},{"Id":63,"Name":"Iyashikei"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":80,"Name":"Visual Arts"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:55"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":880,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":5166,"Completed":17180,"OnHold":2126,"Dropped":4852,"PlanToWatch":19202,"Total":48526},"Favorites":132,"Producers":["CBC Television","Planet","Half H.P Studio","Nippon Columbia","81 Produce","Tokyo MX","BS11","Maho Film","Zipang"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Nippon Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Tobira wo Hiraketara (\u6249\u3092\u958B\u3051\u305F\u3089)\u0022 by MUG-MO"],"Endings":["\u0022Pale Blue\u0022 by Aya Uchida"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=15660","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T20:57:54.724+01:00"},{"Id":42571,"Title":"Dogeza de Tanondemita","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1634/109387.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":10,"Day":14,"Full":"2020-10-14"},"EndDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":12,"Day":30,"Full":"2020-12-30"},"Synopsis":"\u0022Grovel enough, and you\u0027ll get what you want.\u0022\n\nThis is the motto that Suwaru Doge firmly stands by, believing that kneeling and begging will grant him the majestic view of a woman\u0027s naked body.

since she was summoned from Hell by the witch Yurine Hanazono, Jashin-chan\u2014a half-human, half-snake demon\u2014has been searching for any way to go back. One of her options is to kill the one who summoned her, which is much easier said than done. Jashin-chan often finds herself getting violently beaten by Yurine after not only any failed murder attempt, but also when she is just causing mischief, destroying any hope of going back home to Hell.\n\nThe demon is also terrible with money and tends to gamble all of it away at pachinko. In one of these gambling sessions, she loses the three million yen she received from Hell Financing, putting her into a lifelong debt. To avoid repaying it altogether, Jashin-chan flees to Hokkaido to try and hide for the rest of her days, but her wish of having her debts forgotten may just be a pipe dream when someone comes knocking for the money.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.41,"Rank":2283,"Popularity":3581,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":57,"Name":"Gag Humor"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"02:05"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":4794,"Completed":18017,"OnHold":1242,"Dropped":1173,"PlanToWatch":17498,"Total":42724},"Favorites":148,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Nomad"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022halca\u0022 by Arekore Drastic feat.

In the shorts\u0027 story, the Seven Gods of Fortune slack in their duties in heaven, and Susanoo-no-Mikoto banishes them to Awaji Island. In order to return to the heavenly realm, they must help bring happiness to humans and rebuild their virtue. The outcast gods reluctantly grant human wishes and accumulate points in their \u0022god phones\u0022 to be able to return to heaven. They aim to perform good deeds on particularly auspicious days to maximize point accumulation. Despite their best efforts at accumulating virtue, sometimes the Seven Gods of Fortune end up bringing misfortune to humans. When they fail, they lose points, further prolonging their stay on Awaji Island.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":null,"Rank":19115,"Popularity":18379,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":25,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"07:30"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":300,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":21,"Completed":90,"OnHold":10,"Dropped":116,"PlanToWatch":138,"Total":375},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=15754","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T21:07:03.935+01:00"}]

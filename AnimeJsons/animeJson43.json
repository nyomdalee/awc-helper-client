Today, he\u0027s a nobody: a washed-up nonentity made fun of by children and always forced to apologize to his younger boss. A sudden news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang\u0027s cruel murder of the only girlfriend he ever had alongside her brother only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for good, Takemichi flashes back to that same day 12 years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.\n\nAfter being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata\u0027s younger brother. Without thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past. Takemichi urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he is not dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter the flow of time. Given the chance to prevent his ex-girlfriend\u0027s tragic death at the hands of the Tokyo Manji Gang, Takemichi decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.95,"Rank":684,"Popularity":109,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":55,"Name":"Delinquents"},{"Id":78,"Name":"Time Travel"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"02:08"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1421,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":203750,"Completed":713776,"OnHold":39140,"Dropped":56750,"PlanToWatch":201800,"Total":1215216},"Favorites":25262,"Producers":["Mainichi Broadcasting System","Pony Canyon","Kodansha","AT-X","Ultra Super Pictures","Studio Mausu","Sammy"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["LIDENFILMS"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Cry Baby\u0022 by Official HiGE DANdism"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Koko de Iki wo shite (\u3053\u3053\u3067\u606F\u3092\u3057\u3066)\u0022 by eill (eps 1-12)","2: \u0022Tokyo Wonder.

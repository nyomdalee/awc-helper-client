However, his cover is blown, and the spy reveals himself to be an alien in disguise. Amidst the ensuing chaos, Jirou enlists the aid of cafe waitress and magical girl Kikko Hoshino, one of many \u0022superhumans\u0022 who blend into society and secretly protect humanity from extraterrestrial threats. As a member of the government agency known as the Super Population Research Laboratory, Jirou has the dual task of protecting superhumans that defend humanity and disposing of any deemed too dangerous to live. Having proven herself a worthy ally, Kikko is invited to join the agency as its newest recruit.\n\nFast forward five years: disapproval and distaste for superhumans are now commonplace in Tokyo. From government corruption and conflicting ideas of justice, to the morality of superhuman rights, the relationship between humans and the supernatural minority balances precariously in a world pervaded by whispers of unrest and unease. Under mysterious circumstances, Jirou has betrayed the agency, and is now a fugitive on the run. As he skulks through the rainy back alleys of Shinjuku, he is pursued by the very same superhumans that he himself once recruited.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.65,"Rank":6128,"Popularity":2302,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"},{"Id":31,"Name":"Super Power"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"23:00"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1450,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":7001,"Completed":31421,"OnHold":5207,"Dropped":11184,"PlanToWatch":37862,"Total":92675},"Favorites":215,"Producers":["Bandai Visual","Lantis","Tokyo MX","Animatic","Hakuhodo DY Media Partners","Techno Sound","Anime Consortium Japan"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Bones"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Katararezu Tomo (\u30AB\u30BF\u30E9\u30EC\u30BA\u30C8\u30E2)\u0022 by ZAQ"],"Endings":["\u0022The Beginning\u0022 by Yohske Yamamoto (eps 1-4, 6-)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=11343","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T05:08:11.051+01:00"},{"Id":31149,"Title":"Persona 3 the Movie 4: Winter of Rebirth","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/77828.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":1,"Day":23,"Full":"2016-01-23"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":1,"Day":23,"Full":"2016-01-23"},"Synopsis":"\u0022The time of destruction is coming ever closer without a doubt.

Students are taught that these creatures are not considered to be human, but Kei doesn\u0027t pay much attention in class. As a result, his perilously little grasp on this subject proves to be completely irrelevant when he survives an accident that was supposed to claim his life, signaling his rebirth as an Ajin and the start of his days of torment.

is a sport where anybody can be a star when they hold the ball. The rules are simple: one player has to carry the ball past the goalposts across the field while avoiding the other team, who are allowed to use all their force to knock the enemy down. However, the player can pass to a teammate behind them or kick the ball before they are tackled. Unlike other sports, the game continues even when the person holding the ball is taken down.\n\nKenji Gion is a short but feisty high school freshman at Kanagawa High School. Right after the school\u0027s opening ceremony, he meets the tall and timid Sumiaki Iwashimizu, and the two of them get an invitation to observe the rugby club. \n\nWhen Gion watches the match, he realizes that even though big and tall guys have an advantage, there are positions for people of all shapes and sizes. Immediately convinced that he has found a sport he can excel at despite his short stature, he signs up, though Iwashimizu declines. Gion is unable to accept Iwashimizu\u0027s excuses and drags him back into the sport. Their training becomes intense as they aim to become the champions of Hanazono, the national high school rugby championships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.04,"Rank":4150,"Popularity":1983,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":25,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":10932,"Completed":60936,"OnHold":5760,"Dropped":11898,"PlanToWatch":26420,"Total":115946},"Favorites":389,"Producers":["Telecom Animation Film","Mainichi Broadcasting System","Kodansha","Asmik Ace","Sony Music Entertainment","TMS Music"],"Licensors":["Funimation","Crunchyroll"],"Studios":["Madhouse","TMS Entertainment"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Flower\u0022 by Lenny code fiction","2: \u0022Seija no Koushin (\u751F\u8005\u30CE\u884C\u9032)\u0022 by CIVILIAN"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Zenryoku Shounen produced by Tamio Okuda (\u5168\u529B\u5C11\u5E74 produced by \u5965\u7530\u6C11\u751F)\u0022 by Sukima Switch","2: \u0022No Side (\u30CE\u30FC\u30B5\u30A4\u30C9)\u0022 by Alisa Takigawa"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=11580","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T05:15:27.953+01:00"},{"Id":31592,"Title":"Pokemon XY\u0026Z","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1627/140267.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":10,"Day":29,"Full":"2015-10-29"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":10,"Day":27,"Full":"2016-10-27"},"Synopsis":"The journey of Satoshi and his friends through the Kalos region continues!

But Kyouya is not the angel he appears to be: he is actually a mean-spirited sadist who forces Erika to become his \u0022dog\u0022 in exchange for keeping her secret.\n\nBegrudgingly accepting his deal, Erika soon begins to see glimpses of the real Kyouya beneath the multiple layers of his outer persona. As she finds herself falling for him, she can\u0027t help but question if he will ever feel the same way about her. Will Kyouya finally make an honest woman out of Erika, or is she destined to be a \u0022wolf girl\u0022 forever?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.03,"Rank":4018,"Popularity":470,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":18791,"Completed":339815,"OnHold":8448,"Dropped":17067,"PlanToWatch":80846,"Total":464967},"Favorites":1924,"Producers":["VAP","Yomiuri Telecasting","Nippon Television Network"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["TYO Animations"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022LOVE GOOD TIME\u0022 by SpecialThanks"],"Endings":["\u0022Ookami Heart (\u30AA\u30AA\u30AB\u30DF\u30CF\u30FC\u30C8)\u0022 by Oresama.

They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \u0022Seven Deadly Sins,\u0022 were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d\u2019\u00E9tat, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\n\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.65,"Rank":1293,"Popularity":32,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"17:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1470,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":81375,"Completed":1686528,"OnHold":29791,"Dropped":57316,"PlanToWatch":167836,"Total":2022846},"Favorites":19257,"Producers":["Aniplex","Dentsu","Mainichi Broadcasting System","Kodansha","Movic"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["A-1 Pictures"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Netsujou no Spectrum (\u71B1\u60C5\u306E\u30B9\u30DA\u30AF\u30C8\u30E9\u30E0)\u0022 by Ikimonogakari (eps 2-12)","2: \u0022Seven Deadly Sins\u0022 by MAN WITH A MISSION (eps 13-23)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Netsujou no Spectrum (\u71B1\u60C5\u306E\u30B9\u30DA\u30AF\u30C8\u30E9\u30E0)\u0022 by Ikimonogakari (eps 1)","2: \u00227 -seven-\u0022 by FLOW x GRANRODEO (eps 2-12)","3: \u0022Season\u0022 by Alisa Takigawa (eps 13-24)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10596","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T17:12:13.186+01:00"},{"Id":23759,"Title":"Oira no Ski","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/85247.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1930,"Month":3,"Day":7,"Full":"1930-03-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1930-03-07"},"Synopsis":"Animated short features bunnies and tanuki having wacky hijinks while going skiing.

time: 1814. The place: Edo, now known as Tokyo.\n\nOne of the highest populated cities in the world, teeming with peasants, samurai, townsmen, merchants, nobles, artists, courtesans, and perhaps even supernatural things.\n\nA much accomplished artist of his time and now in his mid-fifties, Tetsuzo can boast clients from all over Japan, and tirelessly works in the garbage-loaded chaos of his house-atelier. He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.\n\nThird of Tetsuzo\u0027s four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father\u0027s talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \u0022We\u0027re father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\u0022\n\nDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.\n\nHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited.

Two rabbits wearing skis emerge from two houses covered in snow. The two rabbits go to wake Tanuko, the sleepy raccoon dog, and invite him to go skiing. Tanuko, who does not know how to ski, is apprehensive at first, but decides to take up the challenge after watching the rabbits skillfully ski down the slope. Tanuko nervously goes down the slope. On his first attempt, he falls flat on his back. On his second attempt, he goes too fast, causing his legs and skis to detach from his body. The rabbits decide to show off by doing a ski jump. Tanuko, feeling competitive, sits on an umbrella and speeds down the hill. The umbrella turns into a plane and he soars through the sky. Seeing this, the two rabbits\u0027 bodies join and turn into a sleigh. They proceed to chase Tanuko. Tanuko\u0027s mouth turns into propellers, and he picks up speed. The rabbits go too fast and end up tripping over.

time: 1814. The place: Edo, now known as Tokyo.\n\nOne of the highest populated cities in the world, teeming with peasants, samurai, townsmen, merchants, nobles, artists, courtesans, and perhaps even supernatural things.\n\nA much accomplished artist of his time and now in his mid-fifties, Tetsuzo can boast clients from all over Japan, and tirelessly works in the garbage-loaded chaos of his house-atelier. He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.\n\nThird of Tetsuzo\u0027s four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father\u0027s talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \u0022We\u0027re father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\u0022\n\nDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.\n\nHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai\u0027s daughter: a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)","Mean":7.16,"Rank":3580,"Popularity":3876,"Genres":[{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":80,"Name":"Visual Arts"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":5400,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":791,"Completed":19429,"OnHold":354,"Dropped":230,"PlanToWatch":15590,"Total":36394},"Favorites":64,"Producers":["Sunrise","TV Tokyo","Bandai Visual","OLM","Asatsu DK","DandeLion Animation Studio","Trans Cosmos","Production GoodBook","Asahi Shimbun","Tokyo Theatres"],"Licensors":["NYAV Post","GKIDS"],"Studios":["Production I.G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Saihate ga Mitai (\u6700\u679C\u3066\u304C\u898B\u305F\u3044)\u0022 by Ringo Shiina"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10611","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T03:54:57.531+01:00"},{"Id":23989,"Title":"Maken-Ki!

It\u0027s a savage sport where the strongest survive, and anyone willing to test their mettle can step into the ring. There is, however, a minimum size requirement to be a pro sumo wrestler, and young Hinomaru Ushio, incredibly talented and hardworking though he may be, does not meet that requirement. This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of  sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments.\n\nUshio is under a lot of pressure, as well as a time limit. If he can\u0027t show off his skills in the high school tournaments, he may lose his chance to go pro permanently, and the odds are stacked against him. Instead of enrolling in Ishigami High, the best school for sumo in Japan, he enrolls in Odachi High and must build a sumo club from the ground up with the one devout member Shinya Ozeki. Odachi High is the true underdog of the sumo world, but Ushio has to push forward with all his strength if he is going to make it professionally.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.55,"Rank":1636,"Popularity":1776,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":54,"Name":"Combat Sports"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1410,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":12354,"Completed":64503,"OnHold":5108,"Dropped":8354,"PlanToWatch":29893,"Total":120212},"Favorites":346,"Producers":["Nihon Ad Systems","Pony Canyon","Shueisha","BS11","Jinnan Studio","Cygames","CA-Cygames Anime Fund"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Gonzo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022FIRE GROUND\u0022 by Official HIGE DANdism (Official\u9AED\u7537dism)","2: \u0022Be the NAKED\u0022 by Lead"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Hiizuru Basho (\u65E5\u51FA\u30BA\u30EB\u5834\u6240)\u0022 by Omedetai Atama de Naniyori (\u30AA\u30E1\u3067\u305F\u3044\u982D\u3067\u306A\u306B\u3088\u308A)","2: \u0022Sakura Sake (\u685C\u54B2\u3051\uFF09\u0022 by Yoshida Yamada (\u5409\u7530\u5C71\u7530)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13695","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T19:47:43.143+01:00"},{"Id":37008,"Title":"Tsukipro The Animation 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1651/116291.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":7,"Day":7,"Full":"2021-07-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":12,"Day":29,"Full":"2021-12-29"},"Synopsis":"For the members of SolidS, Growth, SOARA, and QUELL, the Tsukino Talent Productions\u0027 Live 2021 Summer Carnival is coming soon.

She\u0027s encouraged by her best friend, Uki Sawatari, who often has to help her get out of trouble.\n\nThere is just one problem: Kohane does not have any experience in cheerleading. She has absolutely no idea what to do, what to wear, or how to perform. To make matters worse, she has been scared of heights since childhood, and this new sport is full of stunts pulled far from the ground for a girl her size. Enter Hizume Arima, a former cheerleader who wishes to leave her pastime behind. Unfortunately for her, Kohane recognizes Hizume, and will stop at nothing just so she can lead the new squad, even if it means facing her childhood fear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":6.88,"Rank":4619,"Popularity":3281,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":52,"Name":"CGDCT"},{"Id":70,"Name":"Performing Arts"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"23:30"},"Source":"4-koma Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":2777,"Completed":19268,"OnHold":1559,"Dropped":3166,"PlanToWatch":16377,"Total":43147},"Favorites":90,"Producers":["AT-X","Houbunsha","TOHO animation","Tokyo MX","Jinnan Studio","DeNA"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Doga Kobo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Jump Up\u2191 Yell!!

Gradually affected by Sora\u0027s impressive skills, sheer effort, and tireless devotion to basketball, the boys unexpectedly find their burnt-out passion for the game rekindling once again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.27,"Rank":2764,"Popularity":1187,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":50,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"17:55"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1460,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":37924,"Completed":80063,"OnHold":14917,"Dropped":21337,"PlanToWatch":41464,"Total":195705},"Favorites":835,"Producers":["TV Tokyo","Kodansha","AT-X","King Records","DMM pictures"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Diomed\u00E9a"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Happy Go Ducky!\u0022 by the pillows (eps 1-13)","2: \u0022Nevermind (\u30CD\u30D0\u30FC\u30DE\u30A4\u30F3\u30C9)\u0022 by flumpool (eps 13-24)","3: \u0022Humming Bird (\u30CF\u30DF\u30F3\u30B0\u30D0\u30FC\u30C9)\u0022 by BLUE ENCOUNT (eps 25-36)","4: \u0022Rebirth\u0022 by ACIDMAN (eps 37-49)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Tsubasa (\u30C4\u30D0\u30B5)\u0022 by Saji (saji-\u30B5\u30B8) (eps 1-13)","2: \u0022Over\u0022 by Yuuma Uchida (eps 13-24)","3: \u0022Hikari Sasu Hou e (\u5149\u5C04\u3059\u65B9\u3078)\u0022 by Mamoru Miyano (eps 25-36)","4: \u0022Taiyou Runner (\u592A\u967D\u30E9\u30F3\u30CA\u30FC)\u0022 by Shougo Sakamoto (eps 37-38, 40-49)","5: \u0022Happy Go Ducky!\u0022 by the pillows (eps 50)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13848","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T19:53:38.637+01:00"},{"Id":37404,"Title":"Circus","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1939/90811.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":2,"Day":28,"Full":"2018-02-28"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2018-02-28"},"Synopsis":"A concept movie music video for Super Junior-D\u0026E\u0027s single Circus.

There is nobody who it\u0027s okay to hurt,\u0022 as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.\n\nThe war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.75,"Rank":45,"Popularity":80,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":58,"Name":"Gore"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"00:10"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1492,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":135422,"Completed":961401,"OnHold":38793,"Dropped":21809,"PlanToWatch":295075,"Total":1452500},"Favorites":45396,"Producers":["Production I.G","Dentsu","Kodansha","Twin Engine"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Wit Studio"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022MUKANJYO\u0022 by Survive Said The Prophet (eps 1-12)","2: \u0022Dark Crow\u0022 by MAN WITH A MISSION (eps 13-24)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Torches\u0022 by Aimer (eps 1-12)","2: \u0022Drown\u0022 by milet (eps 13-24)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13945","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T19:55:37.413+01:00"},{"Id":37522,"Title":"Pet","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/94794.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":1,"Day":6,"Full":"2020-01-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":3,"Day":30,"Full":"2020-03-30"},"Synopsis":"Despite endless research, the human mind remains a mystery to this day.

Godzilla Earth.\n\nHuman protagonist, Captain Haruo, yearns to defeat Godzilla and retake the planet for mankind. There, he meets aboriginal descendants of the human race, the Houtua tribe. The Houtua twin sisters, Maina and Miana, lead him to the skeletal remains of Mecha-Godzilla, an old anti-Godzilla weapon, which to everyone\u0027s surprise is still alive in the form of self-generating nanometal. Taken from the Mecha-Godzilla carcass, the nanometals have gradually been rebuilding a \u0022Mecha-Godzilla City,\u0022 a potential weapon capable of destroying Godzilla Earth.\n\nAs the strategy develops, a rift forms between the humans and the Bilusaludo, one of several alien races that had joined the humans on their exodus from Earth. Their leader, Galu-gu, believes that the secret to defeating Godzilla lies in the use of superhuman powers \u2013 namely, the nanometal integration \u2013 but Haruo resists, fearing that in defeating monsters, they must not become monsters themselves. Haruo ultimately uses his means for defeating Godzilla Earth to destroy the Mecha-Godzilla city so as to prevent nanometal assimilation, killing Galu-gu. However, his childhood friend, Yuuko, has been absorbed by the nanometal integration and has fallen into a brain dead coma.\n\nThe human race, once again, is lost. Metphies, commander of the priestly alien race, Exif, marvels at the miraculous survival of Haruo, he begins to attract a following. The Exif has secretly harbored this outcome as their \u0022ultimate goal.\u0022 Miana and Maina issue warnings against Metphies, while Haruo begins to question mankind\u0027s next move.\n\nWith no means for defeating Godzilla Earth, mankind watches as King Ghidorah, clad in a golden light, descends on the planet. The earth shakes once again with as war moves to a higher dimension.\n\nWhat is Godzilla exactly? Does mankind stand a chance? Is there a future vision in Haruo\u0027s eyes? Find out in the finale.\n\n(Source: Official site)","Mean":6.23,"Rank":8086,"Popularity":3751,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":5400,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":506,"Completed":26387,"OnHold":187,"Dropped":250,"PlanToWatch":5992,"Total":33322},"Favorites":35,"Producers":["TOHO","TOHO animation"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Polygon Pictures"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022live and die\u0022 by XAI"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=12315","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:01:35.898+01:00"},{"Id":37902,"Title":"One Piece: Episode of Sorajima","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1533/92968.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":8,"Day":25,"Full":"2018-08-25"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2018-08-25"},"Synopsis":"The Straw Hats embark on a dangerous trip to the sky where their destination comes straight out of a fairytale.

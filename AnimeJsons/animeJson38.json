It\u0027s a savage sport where the strongest survive, and anyone willing to test their mettle can step into the ring. There is, however, a minimum size requirement to be a pro sumo wrestler, and young Hinomaru Ushio, incredibly talented and hardworking though he may be, does not meet that requirement. This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of  sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments.\n\nUshio is under a lot of pressure, as well as a time limit. If he can\u0027t show off his skills in the high school tournaments, he may lose his chance to go pro permanently, and the odds are stacked against him. Instead of enrolling in Ishigami High, the best school for sumo in Japan, he enrolls in Odachi High and must build a sumo club from the ground up with the one devout member Shinya Ozeki. Odachi High is the true underdog of the sumo world, but Ushio has to push forward with all his strength if he is going to make it professionally.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.53,"Rank":1814,"Popularity":1858,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":54,"Name":"Combat Sports"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1410,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":12522,"Completed":68527,"OnHold":5275,"Dropped":8752,"PlanToWatch":31267,"Total":126343},"Favorites":348,"Producers":["Nihon Ad Systems","Pony Canyon","Shueisha","BS11","Jinnan Studio","Cygames","CA-Cygames Anime Fund"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Gonzo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022FIRE GROUND\u0022 by Official HIGE DANdism (Official\u9AED\u7537dism)","2: \u0022Be the NAKED\u0022 by Lead"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Hiizuru Basho (\u65E5\u51FA\u30BA\u30EB\u5834\u6240)\u0022 by Omedetai Atama de Naniyori (\u30AA\u30E1\u3067\u305F\u3044\u982D\u3067\u306A\u306B\u3088\u308A)","2: \u0022Sakura Sake (\u685C\u54B2\u3051\uFF09\u0022 by Yoshida Yamada (\u5409\u7530\u5C71\u7530)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13695","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:26:44.064+01:00"},{"Id":37008,"Title":"Tsukipro The Animation 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1651/116291.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":7,"Day":7,"Full":"2021-07-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":12,"Day":29,"Full":"2021-12-29"},"Synopsis":"For the members of SolidS, Growth, SOARA, and QUELL, the Tsukino Talent Productions\u0027 Live 2021 Summer Carnival is coming soon.

A visitor approaches, and suddenly, the fog recedes. A shape begins to take form beside the board\u2014this figure is the masked Storyteller, who once again starts to spin tales of horror and despair.\n\nThe events described in these macabre tales might happen to anyone, even your neighbors or friends: a group of girls bully one of their members in a cave, only to find themselves the victims of a dark presence; a boy with scopophobia moves to the countryside, but he still cannot escape the eyes of others; a man has a window that won\u0027t stay closed, and is the recipient of strange phone calls; and a salaryman steals an umbrella on a rainy day, but this seemingly insignificant act leads to consequences he never expected. Visitors may enjoy the Storyteller\u0027s offerings, but they should also be vigilant so that they don\u0027t wind up as the subjects of his next story.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.21,"Rank":8748,"Popularity":4811,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"},{"Id":14,"Name":"Horror"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"04:00"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":240,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":890,"Completed":14471,"OnHold":364,"Dropped":496,"PlanToWatch":6637,"Total":22858},"Favorites":5,"Producers":["TV Tokyo"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["ILCA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Mayakashi Yokochou (\u307E\u3084\u304B\u3057\u6A2A\u4E01)\u0022 by Aiko Okumura"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14088","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:49:43.093+01:00"},{"Id":37894,"Title":"Ling Yu 4th Season","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1753/92962.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":12,"Day":8,"Full":"2016-12-08"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":2,"Day":23,"Full":"2017-02-23"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":6.62,"Rank":6355,"Popularity":11979,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":843,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":152,"Completed":999,"OnHold":45,"Dropped":79,"PlanToWatch":622,"Total":1897},"Favorites":1,"Producers":["iQIYI"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Haoliners Animation League"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:49:45.844+01:00"},{"Id":37895,"Title":"Ling Yu 5th Season","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1070/92961.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":7,"Day":20,"Full":"2017-07-20"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":10,"Day":5,"Full":"2017-10-05"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":6.57,"Rank":6599,"Popularity":12243,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":780,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":118,"Completed":941,"OnHold":42,"Dropped":74,"PlanToWatch":555,"Total":1730},"Favorites":1,"Producers":["iQIYI"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Haoliners Animation League"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:49:48.646+01:00"},{"Id":37896,"Title":"Ling Yu 6th Season","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1623/92960.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":4,"Day":20,"Full":"2018-04-20"},"EndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":7,"Day":6,"Full":"2018-07-06"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":6.01,"Rank":9795,"Popularity":12400,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":802,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":227,"Completed":630,"OnHold":61,"Dropped":119,"PlanToWatch":615,"Total":1652},"Favorites":1,"Producers":["iQIYI"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Foch Film"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:49:51.184+01:00"},{"Id":37897,"Title":"Godzilla 3: Hoshi wo Kuu Mono","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1556/93690.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":11,"Day":9,"Full":"2018-11-09"},"EndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":11,"Day":9,"Full":"2018-11-09"},"Synopsis":"With the defeat of the Bilusaludo\u0027s nanometal city, the destruction of humanity seems inevitable.

More to the point, in matters of a romantic nature, Pusu-o conducts himself with an absolute lack of grace, restraint and general respect for women. Not surprisingly, his sex life is an endless succession of obnoxiously over-the-top come-ons and maniacal attempts to get some action, all of which culminate in total strike-outs. Pusu-o\u0027s own father is soon on hand to add insult to injury (the injury being the constant, gushing nosebleeds Pusu-o endures \u2014 the nasal blood geyser being Japanese cartoon shorthand for sexual frustration), and the cock blockage continues at Pusu-o\u0027s new job as a car salesman \u2014 until a trio of older women misinterpret his advances, intended only to make the pretty Yukiko jealous. The antics continue at a later date, when the married Pusu-o is cuckolded by an horny little birdie. When the humiliated surrogate dad witnesses the sexual prowess of the tryst\u0027s offspring, matters culminate in a finale worthy of the most bombastic Japanese tragedy. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":5.03,"Rank":null,"Popularity":13978,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[{"Id":12,"Name":"Hentai"}],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1971,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":5780,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":107,"Completed":372,"OnHold":44,"Dropped":161,"PlanToWatch":361,"Total":1045},"Favorites":3,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Tokyo TV Douga"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=3455","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T04:10:17.641+01:00"},{"Id":26085,"Title":"Military!","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68837.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":1,"Day":7,"Full":"2015-01-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":3,"Day":25,"Full":"2015-03-25"},"Synopsis":"The story takes place during a conflict between the Krakozhia Dukedom and the Grania Republic.

However, a meteor shower that fell onto Earth had a strange effect on bears throughout the world: they suddenly became violent and hungry for human flesh, spurring an endless cycle of bloodshed in which bear ate man and man shot bear, forgetting the lively relationship they once had. The \u0022Wall of Severance\u0022 was thus built, separating the two civilizations and keeping peace.\n\nKureha Tsubaki and Sumika Izumino are two lovers attending Arashigaoka Academy, who, upon the arrival of two bears that have sneaked through the Wall of Severance and infiltrated the academy, find their relationship under a grave threat. The hungering yet affectionate bears, Ginko Yurishiro and Lulu Yurigasaki, seem to see the bear-hating Kureha as more than just another meal, and in getting closer to her, trigger an unraveling of secrets that Kureha may not be able to bear.\n\nWhen their relationships provoke the Invisible Storm, a group that keeps order within the ideological school, the girls must stand on trial with their love, embarking on a journey of self-discovery en route to attaining true love\u0027s \u0022promised kiss.\u0022\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.04,"Rank":3935,"Popularity":2006,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":26,"Name":"Girls Love"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":51,"Name":"Anthropomorphic"},{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":5962,"Completed":38406,"OnHold":4549,"Dropped":8803,"PlanToWatch":43374,"Total":101094},"Favorites":748,"Producers":["Frontier Works","Media Factory","Mainichi Broadcasting System","Movic","Gentosha Comics"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["SILVER LINK."],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Ano Mori de Matteru (\u3042\u306E\u68EE\u3067\u5F85\u3063\u3066\u308B)\u0022 by Bonjour Suzuki (\u30DC\u30F3\u30B8\u30E5\u30FC\u30EB\u9234\u6728)"],"Endings":["\u0022TERRITORY\u0022 by Ginko Yurishiro (Miho Arakawa), Lulu Yurigasaki (Yoshiko Ikuta), Kureha Tsubaki (Nozomi Yamane)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10811","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T17:23:52.836+01:00"},{"Id":26183,"Title":"Ikkitousen: Extravaganza Epoch","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1413/133384.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":12,"Day":21,"Full":"2014-12-21"},"EndDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":12,"Day":28,"Full":"2014-12-28"},"Synopsis":"Sonsaku Hakufu along with Shokatsuryou Koumei, Chouhi Ekitoku, and Ryuubi Gentoku are investigating Magatama-related incidents that occurred in the last week.

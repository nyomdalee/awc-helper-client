During the 1970s, actress Mariko Miyagi became heavily involved in the Silk Tree Academy (Nemunoki Gakuen), a rehabilitation center for disabled children. She appeared in several live-action films to promote the project, including The Silk Tree Ballad, Mariko-Mother, and Children Drawing Rainbows. This anime charts the 14-year period of Miyagi\u0027s stewardship of the academy and her relationships with several of the children. Divided into four seasonal chapters, the film uses highly realistic character designs based on the actual people involved and features storyboarding from the versatile Star Blazers-director Noboru Ishiguro.\n\n(Source: AnimeVice)","Mean":null,"Rank":19714,"Popularity":17797,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1981,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":5040,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":24,"Completed":136,"OnHold":7,"Dropped":91,"PlanToWatch":162,"Total":420},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["TV Asahi"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=9165","LastUpdated":"2025-01-06T00:00:29.903+01:00"},{"Id":19185,"Title":"HORIZON feat.

The only way the Speed Stars can stand a chance against them is if they can get the panda-colored AE86 to join their team.

Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing. \n\nGari-Gari is a mad scientist wolf who wants to build a mansion over the junkyard, constantly thinking up evil plans to get the money needed to buy the property, whether it\u2019s creating a machine that creates counterfeit 10 yen (about 10 cents in US money) or stealing priceless paintings and selling it to a high bidder. He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it.

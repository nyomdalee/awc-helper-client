Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird.\n\nThis particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, \u0022Don\u0027t bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it\u2019s only a drop, you can\u0027t put out this fire.\u0022\n\nAnd as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird\u2019s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, \u0022What do you think you are doing?\u0022 And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, \u0022I am doing what I can.\u0022\n\n(Source: sechangersoi.be)","Mean":null,"Rank":19637,"Popularity":21263,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":1140,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":10,"Completed":30,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":41,"PlanToWatch":35,"Total":119},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:22:28.447+01:00"},{"Id":39148,"Title":"Mottainai","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1415/98615.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2005,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2005"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2005"},"Synopsis":"An educational anime about environmental waste aimed at promoting recycling to children.","Mean":null,"Rank":16280,"Popularity":21083,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1320,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":8,"Completed":35,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":38,"PlanToWatch":43,"Total":128},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:22:29.685+01:00"},{"Id":39149,"Title":"Ushiwakamaru","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/98644.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"Synopsis":"A time-slipped Ushiwakamaru (the childhood name of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, a military commander of the Minamoto clan and is known as one of the strongest samurai in the history of Japan) arrives in modern day Japan and has to learn traffic safety, bicycle traffic safety, disaster prevention, and kidnapping prevention.","Mean":null,"Rank":13875,"Popularity":21354,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":4,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":720,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":9,"Completed":27,"OnHold":5,"Dropped":39,"PlanToWatch":35,"Total":115},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:22:31.151+01:00"},{"Id":39150,"Title":"Otogi","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/98672.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":2,"Day":6,"Full":"2019-02-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2019-02-06"},"Synopsis":"Eve\u0027s first press limited edition release of their Otogi album CD includes an accompanying DVD.

This is the story of Closers in New Seoul.\nMysterious dimensional gates opened all over the planet and unleashed a worldwide invasion of dimensional monsters. No monsters and tactics had any effect on the waves of dimensional monsters pouring out of the dimensional gates. City after city was mercilessly destroyed.\n\nBut the opening of the dimensional gates did not only cause damage and destruction. The psychokinetic power that it awoke also enabled a tiny minority of humans to gain extraordinary psychic powers. With these psychic warriors, governments around the world were able to turn the tide of the war with these monsters. After unspeakable losses, the people of earth at least succeeded in closing the gates. Since they had closed the gates, these psychics began to be called \u0022CLOSERS,\u0022 and the invasion of the dimensional monsters was named the First Dimensional War.\n\nWith the dimensional monsters vanquished, peace returned to the world, and the cities were rebuilt. Through dedicated research into the dimensional gates and psychokinetic power, humans learned that the gates open when there is a singularity in this mysterious power. However, their understanding of the gates was still incomplete. The CLOSERS who survived the First Dimensional War became part of an organization called UNION. Together, they researched the psychokinetic power in all over the world, working to prevent another dimensional war.\n\nAnd that\u0027s when the dimensional gates all over the world started shaking again - as ever stronger outbreed creatures renewed the attack on earth.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":6.19,"Rank":8287,"Popularity":4790,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":11,"Name":"Strategy Game"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":6,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":1008,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":3307,"Completed":787,"OnHold":1281,"Dropped":1185,"PlanToWatch":12200,"Total":18760},"Favorites":70,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Studio Animal"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Close the World\u0022 by Chohee"],"Endings":["\u0022Closer To Your Side\u0022 by Elika"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=12922","LastUpdated":"2023-08-29T19:48:14.616+02:00"},{"Id":32153,"Title":"Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica: Concept Movie","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/77732.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":11,"Day":27,"Full":"2015-11-27"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2015-11-27"},"Synopsis":"Contemplating the meaning of happiness, Madoka Kaname and Homura Akemi compose possible answers that lead them to reflect on their own choices.

However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob\u0027s explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.49,"Rank":132,"Popularity":32,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":31,"Name":"Super Power"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":107121,"Completed":1511401,"OnHold":40686,"Dropped":29247,"PlanToWatch":298082,"Total":1986537},"Favorites":46115,"Producers":["Warner Bros.

With this monumental goal, could the weight of it all destroy the pair\u0027s friendship completely? \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.5,"Rank":6613,"Popularity":3117,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"23:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":3590,"Completed":18121,"OnHold":2241,"Dropped":5561,"PlanToWatch":15816,"Total":45329},"Favorites":92,"Producers":["Lantis","Rakuonsha","AT-X","KlockWorx","Kadokawa"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Studio Gokumi","AXsiZ"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022hopeness\u0022 by ZAQ"],"Endings":["\u0022LoSe\u00B1CoNtRoL\u0022 by Nene Nanakorobi (Sanae Fuku) \u0026 Clarion (Manami Numakura)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=11815","LastUpdated":"2023-08-29T19:48:32.987+02:00"},{"Id":32215,"Title":"High School DxD BorN: Yomigaeranai Fushichou","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":12,"Day":9,"Full":"2015-12-09"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2015-12-09"},"Synopsis":"Unaired anime episode bundled with the limited edition of High School DxD DX.2.","Mean":7.42,"Rank":2053,"Popularity":1578,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":2726,"Completed":111618,"OnHold":945,"Dropped":719,"PlanToWatch":18971,"Total":134979},"Favorites":269,"Producers":["Genco","Lantis","Kadokawa"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TNK"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022BLESS YoUr NAME\u0022 by ChouCho"],"Endings":["\u0022Give Me Secret (\u30AE\u30D6\u30DF\u30FC\u30FB\u30B7\u30FC\u30AF\u30EC\u30C3\u30C8)\u0022 by StylipS"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=11844","LastUpdated":"2023-08-29T19:48:35.933+02:00"},{"Id":32218,"Title":"Choujikuu Seiki Orguss Memorial","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/78066.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1985,"Month":3,"Day":28,"Full":"1985-03-28"},"EndDate":{"Year":1985,"Month":5,"Day":28,"Full":"1985-05-28"},"Synopsis":"Summary of The Super Dimension Century Orguss TV series.","Mean":null,"Rank":18542,"Popularity":14664,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":2,"StartSeason":{"Year":1985,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":3000,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":39,"Completed":185,"OnHold":15,"Dropped":72,"PlanToWatch":263,"Total":574},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Tokyo Movie Shinsha","Victor Entertainment"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Artland"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-08-29T19:48:36.613+02:00"},{"Id":32219,"Title":"Raldessia Chronicles","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77367.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":5,"Day":20,"Full":"2013-05-20"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2013-05-20"},"Synopsis":"DeNA\u0027s promotional anime video for its mobile game Raldessia Chronicles.\n","Mean":5.21,"Rank":12003,"Popularity":13719,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":46,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":38,"Completed":476,"OnHold":6,"Dropped":51,"PlanToWatch":198,"Total":769},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["DeNA"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-08-29T19:48:37.09+02:00"},{"Id":32221,"Title":"Robocar Poli 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/78248.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":12,"Day":26,"Full":"2011-12-26"},"EndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":5,"Day":15,"Full":"2012-05-15"},"Synopsis":"In Broom\u0027s Town, a small town with a strong rescue team, there are always accidents and troubles such as a car sliding off a cliff in the rain, a car crash, a child locked in a firehouse and so on.

Claiming that she will die if he doesn\u0027t kiss someone within 24 hours, Guri\u0027s pleas of desperation are misunderstood as pleas for love, leading Seiji to kiss the cute stranger that came barging into his house. In actuality, it turns out that this cosplaying cupid is the wielder of a Kiss Note, in which any pairing of names she writes will kiss and become a couple. Guri explains that she misspelt and accidentally wrote Seiji\u0027s name while indulging in her yaoi fantasies, but because she had yet to pair him with anyone, their kiss was meaningless. Even worse, Guri reveals that if Seiji is not coupled with anyone soon, not only will she die, but Seiji will remain a virgin for eternity!\n\nEager to escape his fate, Seiji sets his sights on the beautiful and popular Akane Hiyama. But after Akane hears that he kissed Guri, she reveals the obsessive and psychopathic feelings that she holds for the unfortunate boy and proceeds to viciously attack them. In the ensuing confusion, Guri is able to pair Seiji with Akane in the Kiss Note, temporarily saving Seiji from any further bodily harm. But to complicate matters, Guri\u0027s newfound feelings lead her to also pair the two of them with herself. Just when the situation could not get any more convoluted, this new coupling with Guri has turned Seiji and Akane into temporary angels, forcing them into assisting the cupid with her work of pairing humans, lest they be cast into hell. With all semblance of normality snatched from his life, Seiji gets to work at matchmaking with these eccentric girls by his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.62,"Rank":5936,"Popularity":620,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"02:35"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":25554,"Completed":225260,"OnHold":9704,"Dropped":23543,"PlanToWatch":74497,"Total":358558},"Favorites":649,"Producers":["TV Tokyo","Sotsu","Half H.P Studio","KlockWorx","DIVE II Entertainment","Avex Pictures","bilibili","Crunchyroll"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["EMT Squared"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!

No longer facing humanity\u0027s extinction, the children are awakened from their slumber.

The six most powerful children are given command of the reclaimed cities, using their powers to defend the strongholds against the continuing invasion. Childhood friends Ichiya Suzaku and Canaria Utara lead Tokyo, siblings Kasumi and Asuha Chigusa manage Chiba, and Maihime Tenkawa and Hotaru Rindou oversee Kanagawa.\n\nOver time, the almost routine attacks from the Unknown and the clashing personalities of the city heads and subheads cultivate petty rivalries, leading to constant arguments between the three cities.

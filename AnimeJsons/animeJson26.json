In a panicked state, she plunges her blood saber into him only to realize that he\u0027s an immortal being. From then on, the two form an impromptu friendship that revolves around Mirai constantly trying to kill Akihito, in an effort to boost her own wavering confidence as a Spirit World warrior. Eventually, Akihito also manages to convince her to join the Literary Club, which houses two other powerful Spirit World warriors, Hiroomi and Mitsuki Nase.\n\nAs the group\u0027s bond strengthens, however, so does the tenacity of the youmu around them.

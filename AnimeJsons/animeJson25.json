Ginko aims to answer her curiosity as he follows Kumado into a \u0022Path of Thorns,\u0022 a place where Mushi flow from their own strange sources into the world of the living.

The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters.

But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.72,"Rank":57,"Popularity":927,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":63,"Name":"Iyashikei"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":15363,"Completed":138663,"OnHold":6725,"Dropped":3475,"PlanToWatch":111167,"Total":275393},"Favorites":1520,"Producers":["Aniplex","Kodansha","Delfi Sound"],"Licensors":["Aniplex of America"],"Studios":["Artland"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022SHIVER\u0022 by Lucy Rose"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Kusa no Shitone (\u8349\u306E\u8335)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 1)","2: \u0022Kaoru Yami (\u9999\u308B\u95C7)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 2)","3: \u0022Nokori Beni (\u6B8B\u308A\u7D05)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 3)","4: \u0022Komori E (\u96A0\u308A\u6C5F)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 4)","5: \u0022Hikari no Ou (\u5149\u306E\u7DD2)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 5)","6: \u0022Koten no Hoshi (\u58FA\u5929\u306E\u661F)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 6)","7: \u0022Mizu Aomu (\u6C34\u78A7\u3080)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 7)","8: \u0022Ikatsuchi no Tamoto (\u96F7\u306E\u8882)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 8)","9: \u0022Doro no Kusa (\u6CE5\u306E\u8349)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 9)","10: \u0022Tokoshie no Ki (\u5E38\u306E\u6A39)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 10)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10571","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T03:59:35.765+01:00"},{"Id":24703,"Title":"High School DxD BorN","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/73642.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"2015-04-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":6,"Day":20,"Full":"2015-06-20"},"Synopsis":"The Red Dragon Emperor, Issei Hyoudou, and the Occult Research Club are back in action as summer break comes for the students of Kuoh Academy.

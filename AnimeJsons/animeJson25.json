In response to their arrival, an organization called the Border Defense Agency has been established to combat the Neighbor menace through special weapons called \u0022Triggers.\u0022 Even though several years have passed after the gate first opened, Neighbors are still a threat and members of Border remain on guard to ensure the safety of the planet.\n\nDespite this delicate situation, members-in-training, such as Osamu Mikumo, are not permitted to use their Triggers outside of headquarters. But when the mysterious new student in his class is dragged into a forbidden area by bullies, they are attacked by Neighbors, and Osamu has no choice but to do what he believes is right. Much to his surprise, however, the transfer student Yuuma Kuga makes short work of the aliens, revealing that he is a humanoid Neighbor in disguise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.58,"Rank":1488,"Popularity":542,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":73,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"06:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1395,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":53830,"Completed":152967,"OnHold":28305,"Dropped":34657,"PlanToWatch":143035,"Total":412794},"Favorites":2787,"Producers":["TV Asahi"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022GIRIGIRI\u0022 by Sonar Pocket (eps 1-23)","2: \u0022Ashita no Hikari (\u30A2\u30B7\u30BF\u30CE\u30D2\u30AB\u30EA)\u0022 by AAA (eps 27-47)","3: \u0022Dream Trigger (\u30C9\u30EA\u30FC\u30E0\u30C8\u30EA\u30AC\u30FC)\u0022 by Pile (eps 49-72)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Ashita no Hikari (\u30A2\u30B7\u30BF\u30CE\u30D2\u30AB\u30EA)\u0022 by AAA (eps 24-26)","2: \u0022Dream Trigger (\u30C9\u30EA\u30FC\u30E0\u30C8\u30EA\u30AC\u30FC)\u0022 by Pile (eps 48, 73)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10657","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T17:15:14.14+01:00"},{"Id":24415,"Title":"Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68299.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":1,"Day":11,"Full":"2015-01-11"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":6,"Day":30,"Full":"2015-06-30"},"Synopsis":"Seirin prepares to face major obstacles on their path to winning the Winter Cup, including the teams each possessing a member of the Generation of Miracles.

The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters.

But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had.

When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project\u0027s ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.29,"Rank":260,"Popularity":327,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1490,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":155478,"Completed":320219,"OnHold":19504,"Dropped":20654,"PlanToWatch":112859,"Total":628714},"Favorites":11488,"Producers":["TV Asahi","Kodansha","Toy\u0027s Factory","Crunchyroll","Bandai Spirits","Bandai Namco Filmworks","Bandai Namco Music Live"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["8bit"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022\u30AB\u30AA\u30B9\u304C\u6975\u307E\u308B\u0022 by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 1-12)","\u0022Judgement\u0022 by ASH DA HERO (eps 13-)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Chaos ga Kiwamaru (\u30AB\u30AA\u30B9\u304C\u6975\u307E\u308B)\u0022 by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 1,24)","2: \u0022WINNER\u0022 by Shuugo Nakamura (eps 2-12)","3: \u0022Judgement\u0022 by ASH DA HERO (eps 13)","4: \u0022Numbness like a ginger\u0022 by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 15-23)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=16519","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:58:23.892+01:00"},{"Id":49598,"Title":"Rich Keikan Cash!","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1513/117198.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":10,"Day":1,"Full":"2021-10-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"Synopsis":"The manga follows a police officer named Cash who solves any and all cases with the power of money.

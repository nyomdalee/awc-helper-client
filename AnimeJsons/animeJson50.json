Their plan appears to be successful until an all-too-familiar feeling of procrastination creates a rowdy distraction for Natsumi.\n\nOn another day, Natsumi asks her teacher Kazuho Miyauchi if she can form and lead a new badminton school club. While the lack of funding and equipment proves to be a major setback, it does not stop Natsumi and the other girls from asking the candy store owner Kaede Kagayama for some help. During their spontaneous badminton practice, a minor accident leads Kaede to reminisce about a memorable day when she babysat Renge Miyauchi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":8.15,"Rank":460,"Popularity":4740,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":52,"Name":"CGDCT"},{"Id":63,"Name":"Iyashikei"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1320,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":699,"Completed":14975,"OnHold":293,"Dropped":140,"PlanToWatch":7600,"Total":23707},"Favorites":31,"Producers":[],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["SILVER LINK."],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Tsugihagi Moyou (\u3064\u304E\u306F\u304E\u3082\u3088\u3046)\u0022 by nano.RIPE"],"Endings":["\u0022Tadaima (\u305F\u3060\u3044\u307E)\u0022 by Renge Miyauchi (CV: Kotori Koiwai), Hotaru Ichijou (CV: Rie Murakawa), Natsumi Koshigaya (CV: Ayane Sakura), Komari Koshigaya (CV: Kana Asumi)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=16507","LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T00:07:36.116+01:00"},{"Id":49522,"Title":"Toutotsu ni Egypt Shin 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1448/122765.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":1,"Day":11,"Full":"2023-01-11"},"EndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":3,"Day":15,"Full":"2023-03-15"},"Synopsis":"Second season of Toutotsu ni Egypt Shin web series.","Mean":6.62,"Rank":6319,"Popularity":10301,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":300,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":226,"Completed":1618,"OnHold":56,"Dropped":148,"PlanToWatch":1070,"Total":3118},"Favorites":6,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Typhoon Graphics"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Kosharizm (\u30B3\u30B7\u30E3\u30EA\u30BA\u30E0)\u0022 by Anubis (Hiro Shimono) and Thoth (Yuki Kaji)"],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=16508","LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T00:07:38.798+01:00"},{"Id":49523,"Title":"Digimon Adventure 02: The Beginning","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1331/137453.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":10,"Day":27,"Full":"2023-10-27"},"EndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":10,"Day":27,"Full":"2023-10-27"},"Synopsis":"Two years after the battle against Eosmon, Davis Motomiya, Ken Ichijouji, Yolei Inoue, Cody Hida, T.K.

When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project\u0027s ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top.

Once a fairy has been stripped of a wing, whoever possesses it holds the fairy\u0027s life in their hands. Taking advantage of this, humans enslaved fairies, but 15-year-old Ann Halford longs to see the day when fairies and humans are treated as equals.\n\nThe aspiring confectioner dreams of becoming a Silver Sugar Master just like her late mother. In order to achieve this lofty goal, Ann sets out for the capital of Lewiston, home to the annual Royal Candy Fair. However, to be bestowed the elusive title, Ann\u0027s confection crafted from silver sugar must be recognized with a royal medal at the event.\n\nAnn hires a sharp-tongued warrior fairy, Shall Fen Shall, to be her bodyguard for the perilous journey ahead. After saving him from his cruel fairy trader, she promises to return Shall\u0027s wing to him once they reach the capital, much to his confusion.

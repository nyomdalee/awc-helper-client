is said that fireworks can calm the souls of the dead. For Tomoya Sugisaki, Aoi Harukawa, and Ryou Kobayashi, fireworks are what allowed them to meet the Summer Ghost. Believed to be the spirit of a young woman who committed suicide, the Summer Ghost only appears in a specific area and can only be seen by those who are within arm\u0027s reach of death. \n\nTomoya is a creative soul being crushed by his academic obligation to get into a good university. Aoi is a meek girl who is relentlessly bullied by her classmates. Ryou is a former basketball star who had to forfeit his passion following a grim diagnosis. The only thing these three have in common is their ability to see the Summer Ghost. The Summer Ghost is said to be able to answer any and all questions pertaining to death\u2014something the three teenagers desperately want to know more about.\n\nDissatisfied with their initial meeting, Tomoya sets out to find the Summer Ghost once again. But the more time he spends with the ghost, the more the mystery surrounding her existence unravels.\n\n[Written by MAL

However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.31,"Rank":240,"Popularity":360,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":62,"Name":"Isekai"},{"Id":72,"Name":"Reincarnation"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":20,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"22:30"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":97127,"Completed":348715,"OnHold":9316,"Dropped":14420,"PlanToWatch":115486,"Total":585064},"Favorites":13495,"Producers":["AT-X","BS NTV","Kadokawa","NewGin","Aiming"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Nexus"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022HIGHEST\u0022 by OxT"],"Endings":["\u0022Darling in the Night\u0022 by \u4E03\u9670"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=16073","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:44:39.915+01:00"},{"Id":48317,"Title":"Iyagi Yeohaeng","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1551/114508.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2014"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2015"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":20184,"Popularity":21882,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":96,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":740,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":5,"Completed":35,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":28,"PlanToWatch":26,"Total":96},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:44:40.41+01:00"},{"Id":48318,"Title":"Iljimae","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1875/114510.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":5,"Day":5,"Full":"2009-05-05"},"EndDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":11,"Day":2,"Full":"2009-11-02"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":20139,"Popularity":19464,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":13,"Completed":43,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":43,"PlanToWatch":115,"Total":218},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:44:41.627+01:00"},{"Id":48320,"Title":"Jeonsa Ryan","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/114505.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1997,"Month":7,"Day":19,"Full":"1997-07-19"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1997-07-19"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":20202,"Popularity":20931,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1997,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":4800,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":6,"Completed":40,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":30,"PlanToWatch":52,"Total":136},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:44:43.432+01:00"},{"Id":48321,"Title":"Jeong-geul-eseo Sal-anamgi: Maru Adventure","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1419/115255.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":8,"Day":31,"Full":"2015-08-31"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":8,"Day":29,"Full":"2016-08-29"},"Synopsis":"Maru and friends\u0027 exciting adventure begin when they were lost in Borneo Jungle.

As a result, schools have begun incorporating these technologies into their curriculum, leaving behind the ways of the old. One such institution is the elite Yuyu Girls\u0027 Vocational High School, where both Serufu Yua and her childhood friend, Miku \u0022Purin\u0022 Suride, have applied. Although the tech-savvy Purin is accepted to Yuyu High, the accident-prone Serufu is rejected and enters the traditional Gatagata Girls\u0027 High School instead, driving a wedge into their friendship.\n\nOn her way to class one day, Serufu gets into a bike accident, and Rei Yasaku, a passerby who attends the same school, fixes her damaged bicycle. Serufu later finds out that Rei has a passion for old-fashioned crafts and is the head of the school\u0027s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Club\u2014which is in danger of closing due to a lack of members.\n\nRealizing that this may be her chance to repair her relationship with Purin, Serufu joins the club in hopes of creating projects that could bring them together once more. As the DIY Club welcomes new faces, Serufu learns to build not only handicrafts but also new friendships along the way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.46,"Rank":1937,"Popularity":1980,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":52,"Name":"CGDCT"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Thrusday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":13758,"Completed":41292,"OnHold":3554,"Dropped":5742,"PlanToWatch":38613,"Total":102959},"Favorites":543,"Producers":["TV Tokyo","AT-X","TV Tokyo Music","Avex Pictures","BS11","Sumitomo","MAGNET"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["PINE JAM"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022\u3069\u304D\u3069\u304D\u30A2\u30A4\u30C7\u30A2\u3092\u3088\u308D\u3057\u304F\uFF01\u0022 by \u6F5F\u5973DIY\u90E8!!"],"Endings":["\u0022\u7D9A\u304F\u8A71\u0022 by Serufu (CV: Konomi Inagaki) and Purin (CV: Kana Ichinose)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=16163","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:47:10.902+01:00"},{"Id":48543,"Title":"Shouxi Yu Ling Shi 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/113661.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":3,"Day":3,"Full":"2021-03-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":9,"Day":15,"Full":"2021-09-15"},"Synopsis":"Second season of Shouxi Yu Ling Shi.\n","Mean":6.14,"Rank":8508,"Popularity":14169,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":60,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":679,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":169,"Completed":219,"OnHold":44,"Dropped":84,"PlanToWatch":228,"Total":744},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Suoyi Technology"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:47:11.607+01:00"},{"Id":48544,"Title":"Ikinuke!

Ten years later, the best wine can be brewed. Finally, he stole a land deed from his home and ran hundreds of miles to Chaisang City to open a wine shop. But a long street is already full of evil stars. Only he is really a young boy who is serious about making wine. Because of this, he was inexplicably involved in the disputes between the two families. On the way, he accidentally met Sikong Changfeng, a vagabond wandering around the rivers and lakes without father and mother, and Lei Mengsha, the son of Zhuo Mo, who rushed from Tianqi City, because they were grateful to each other. He decided to help Lei Mengsha rescue his good brother, Gu Jianmen, the son of Lingyun, who was trapped in his mansion.

Xie Xuan, who later became Confucian Sword Immortal, Yan Zhantian, who became Nujian Immortal, and Luo Qingyang, who became Lone Sword Immortal, were all still unknown at this time. They were waiting for the day when they would meet each other and then become famous all over the world.\n\n(Source: Bangumi, translated)","Mean":6.87,"Rank":4685,"Popularity":12200,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":17,"Name":"Martial Arts"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":20,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Web Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1136,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":377,"Completed":293,"OnHold":43,"Dropped":101,"PlanToWatch":509,"Total":1323},"Favorites":13,"Producers":["Youku"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["CG Year"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17058","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:50:26.608+01:00"},{"Id":48868,"Title":"Jiuzhou Feichang Dao","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1866/114691.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":14909,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":16,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":599,"Total":599},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Qiying Animation","Sanfu Interactive Entertainment","Shenfan Animation"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:50:28.425+01:00"},{"Id":48869,"Title":"Trepanation","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1313/114692.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":4,"Day":30,"Full":"2021-04-30"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021-04-30"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Trepanation by millenium parade, directed by Ryoji Yamada.","Mean":6.41,"Rank":null,"Popularity":12174,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":222,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":48,"Completed":933,"OnHold":11,"Dropped":21,"PlanToWatch":324,"Total":1337},"Favorites":4,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["PERIMETRON","Mimoid"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:50:29.923+01:00"},{"Id":48872,"Title":"With Pochi!

The central character, Shinji, is a boy who loves to draw. In elementary school, he encounters Masaru, a strange young boy who also loves drawing, but who draws only masked wrestlers. The two become friends. \n\nAs they progress through their elementary school grades, however, they gradually grow apart. Years later, Shinji still remains true to his dream of becoming a manga artist, and goes on to study art at the university. When his work is selected for a Best Young Artist Award, he decides to move to Tokyo and soon gets his first breakthrough. What awaits him there, though, is something completely different from the manga artist\u2019s life that he had imagined. One day, for the first time in years, the 30-year-old Shinji comes across some work of his old friend Masaru, who has remained true to his drawing style. \n\nThe story is a mockumentary (\u0022mock documentary\u0022), and the narration is interspersed with monologues by Shinji\u0027s mother. As the central character grows, the animation style evolves from juvenile drawings doodled on random pieces of paper to sketches drawn on specialized manga paper, thus visualizing the flow of time.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)","Mean":6.93,"Rank":4425,"Popularity":12964,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"},{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1261,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":29,"Completed":565,"OnHold":14,"Dropped":47,"PlanToWatch":393,"Total":1048},"Favorites":7,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Nekonigashi Inc."],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:52:06.377+01:00"},{"Id":48994,"Title":"Closure no Kimitsu File","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1852/131810.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":5,"Day":16,"Full":"2021-05-16"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":11,"Day":21,"Full":"2021-11-21"},"Synopsis":"Animated shorts showing the daily life on Rhodes Island.","Mean":6.09,"Rank":8766,"Popularity":17535,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":17,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":131,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":17,"Completed":203,"OnHold":11,"Dropped":31,"PlanToWatch":77,"Total":339},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Yostar Pictures"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T22:52:07.475+01:00"},{"Id":48997,"Title":"Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":1,"Day":12,"Full":"2022-01-12"},"EndDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":3,"Day":30,"Full":"2022-03-30"},"Synopsis":"Since their days as students, Tsukasa Jinguuji has had incredible luck with women due to his good looks; Hinata Tachibana has had almost none, overshadowed by Jinguuji\u0027s brilliance.

In accordance with the rules of the province, a person was exiled to an island when they turned 60 years old. On the night of August 15th, there was one such farmer woman, but her son loved her, and took her to a mountain to leave her there instead of turning her over to the cruel officers. However, he felt sorry about what he was doing and hid her under the earthen floor of a barn. One day, a messenger of the lord of the neighboring province was sent to the lord of Shinano Province making an unreasonable demand that a silk thread be threaded through a winding hole in a crystal ball and threatened that force would be used unless the task was done. The devoted son consulted with his mother, and she taught him a method in which you put honey around the end of one hole and let an ant tied with a thread go through it from the other end. The lord rewarded the son. However, a messenger was sent from the neighboring province again demanding that they identify which of two identical mares is the parent and which is the child. The son asked his mother again and then told the solution to the lord. When told by the lord that he would grant the son\u2019s wish, he pleaded for his mother\u2019s life. Since then, old men and women have been treated with respect and are no longer exiled.\n\n(Source: Japanese Animated Film Classics)","Mean":5.48,"Rank":12072,"Popularity":12874,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1080,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":33,"Completed":1116,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":74,"PlanToWatch":182,"Total":1413},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6830","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T04:15:55.583+01:00"},{"Id":27575,"Title":"Spy Gekimetsu","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/66779.webp","StartDate":{"Year":1942,"Month":7,"Day":16,"Full":"1942-07-16"},"EndDate":{"Year":1942,"Month":7,"Day":16,"Full":"1942-07-16"},"Synopsis":"A war propaganda film which begins with Roosevelt and Churchill in a secret meeting preparing their spy plans.

They decide to discover the contents of the flash drive by any means necessary, but to their surprise, it merely contained pictures of an idol that Yuuta adored back in middle school. However, Rikka takes offense, as she claims that this breaks their contract as lovers and demands Yuuta to return the flash drive.\n\nAlthough having seen Yuuta return the flash drive, she still felt uncertain about the situation. This leads to her sneaking into Yuuta\u0027s room during the night, only to find out that the flash drive had not been returned! Scanning through its contents, she hurriedly rushes to bed when Yuuta enters her room. To her terror, she finds the flash drive crushed due to her negligence in keeping it in a safe place. Yuuta quickly finds out and demands an apology. However, Rikka too, demands an apology from him, resulting in both of them refusing to be the one to apologize first. Will the two lovebirds be able to resolve their argument?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.45,"Rank":2141,"Popularity":1715,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1415,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":2491,"Completed":109765,"OnHold":1201,"Dropped":633,"PlanToWatch":25792,"Total":139882},"Favorites":121,"Producers":["Lantis"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Kyoto Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022VOICE\u0022 by ZAQ"],"Endings":["\u0022Van!shment Th!s World\u0022 by Black Raison d\u0027\u00EAtre (Maaya Uchida, Chinatsu Akasaki, Azumi Asakura, Sumire Uesaka)"]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T04:16:08.156+01:00"},{"Id":27603,"Title":"Jutaijima","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/104089.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":12,"Day":19,"Full":"2014-12-19"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":1,"Day":23,"Full":"2015-01-23"},"Synopsis":"It was a school field trip that went terribly, terribly wrong.

While conducting training exercises 80 miles off Okinawa, an A4 strike aircraft is loaded with a B43 hydrogen bomb, but it falls overboard and sinks in 16,000 feet of water. Based on the true story of the USS Ticonderoga, which reached Japan two days later (on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor; nice touch). Neither side revealed the incident, nor that she was carrying atomic weapons in contravention of U.S. treaties with Japan. The plane, its pilot, and the bomb were never recovered, and the incident was only declassified in 1989, causing an outcry in Japan and resulting in this environmentally themed anime. The extra \u0022n\u0022 in Ticonderonga may be a genuine error in transcription or an attempt to distance the story from real events, since the anime continues with Ashika, a boy from a Japanese fishing town, contacted by telepathic whales who bring him visions of fearful seamonsters.

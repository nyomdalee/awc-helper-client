Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi.\n\nDuring his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals\u2014those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi\u2014inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen. Moreover, as a Mushishi, Ginko must learn more about these strange beings and decide if he has the right to interfere with the complex relationships between Mushi and mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.69,"Rank":59,"Popularity":790,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":63,"Name":"Iyashikei"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":15625,"Completed":145696,"OnHold":7666,"Dropped":3456,"PlanToWatch":122981,"Total":295424},"Favorites":1549,"Producers":["Aniplex","Kodansha","Delfi Sound"],"Licensors":["Aniplex of America"],"Studios":["Artland"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Shiver\u0022 by Lucy Rose"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Nozue no Utage (\u91CE\u672B\u306E\u5BB4)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 1)","2: \u0022Saezuru Kai (\u56C0\u308B\u8C9D)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 2)","3: \u0022Yuki no Shita (\u96EA\u306E\u4E0B)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 3)","4: \u0022Yoru wo Naderu Te (\u591C\u3092\u64AB\u3067\u308B\u624B)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 4)","5: \u0022Kagami ga Fuchi (\u93E1\u304C\u6DF5)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 5)","6: \u0022Hana Madoi (\u82B1\u60D1\u3044)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 6)","7: \u0022Hi Teru Ame (\u65E5\u7167\u308B\u96E8)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 7)","8: \u0022Shimaki Tatsu (\u98A8\u5DFB\u7ACB\u3064)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 8)","9: \u0022Ushio Waku Tani (\u6F6E\u308F\u304F\u8C37)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 9)","10: \u0022Fuyu no Soko (\u51AC\u306E\u5E95)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 10)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10384","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T17:00:55.86+01:00"},{"Id":21941,"Title":"Sore Ike!

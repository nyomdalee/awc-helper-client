Ippatsuman is the sixth in the Time Bokan series. In the 1990s-era Osteandel City is the headquarters of Time Lease, a business that leases almost everything you could ask for including powerful robots. They are proud of themselves for being number one in the international ranking of billionaires, for the past ten consecutive years. Meanwhile there is another lease company in the same city called Skull Lease where the notorious villain trio work as top executives. Their ostensible object is to disgrace the credit of Time Lease and replace them as the leading enterprise. In fact, however, they have a scheme to secure a footing for world conquest. One day a transport robot of Time Lease is assaulted by the villain trio and it is time for Ippatsuman to get on the move to fight for justice.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":5.83,"Rank":9949,"Popularity":12438,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":58,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":88,"Completed":386,"OnHold":58,"Dropped":164,"PlanToWatch":528,"Total":1224},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Tatsunoko Production"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Gyakuten Ippatsuman (\u9006\u8EE2\u30A4\u30C3\u30D1\u30C4\u30DE\u30F3)\u0022 by \u30B8\u30E3\u30E9, Igarashi Rei, Kawakami Tomoko, \u7DBE\u5D0E\u30DF\u30AD, Takemasa Hiroko, Pink Piggies, Yamamoto Masayuki, Hamura Kyouko, \u9AD8\u67F3\u5BCC\u5B50, \u91CD\u7530\u7531\u7F8E\u5B50, \u4E2D\u5C3E\u7F8E\u8CB4"],"Endings":["\u0022Shibibiin Rhapsody (\u30B7\u30D3\u30D3\u30FC\u30F3\u30FB\u30E9\u30D7\u30BD\u30C7\u30A3\u30FC)\u0022 by \u30B8\u30E3\u30E9, Igarashi Rei, Kawakami Tomoko, \u7DBE\u5D0E\u30DF\u30AD, Takemasa Hiroko, Pink Piggies, Yamamoto Masayuki, Hamura Kyouko, \u9AD8\u67F3\u5BCC\u5B50, \u91CD\u7530\u7531\u7F8E\u5B50, \u4E2D\u5C3E\u7F8E\u8CB4"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=2549","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T18:02:29.971+01:00"},{"Id":8017,"Title":"Soukou Kihei Votoms: Genei-hen","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1553/97716.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":3,"Day":26,"Full":"2010-03-26"},"EndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":10,"Day":27,"Full":"2010-10-27"},"Synopsis":"For their silver anniversary, Vanilla and Coconna return to Uoodo along with Gotho in the hopes of reuniting with Chirico.

A string of droughts and other natural disasters tear the family apart, and Gusuko is forced to leave home and seek his fortunes on his own.

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji\u0027s story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can\u0027t put your finger on the reason why, it\u0027s probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii\u0027s artsy 1986 feature Angel\u0027s Egg. That, and Kenji\u0027s wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki\u0027s Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji\u0027s story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji\u0027s magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.\n\n(Source: pelleas.net)","Mean":5.82,"Rank":10006,"Popularity":13043,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1988,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1450,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":35,"Completed":410,"OnHold":24,"Dropped":62,"PlanToWatch":492,"Total":1023},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Konami"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Madhouse"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=4843","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T18:06:53.655+01:00"},{"Id":8456,"Title":"Queen\u0027s Blade: Utsukushiki Toushi-tachi","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/34325.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":8,"Day":8,"Full":"2010-08-08"},"EndDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":3,"Day":14,"Full":"2011-03-14"},"Synopsis":"Queen\u0027s Blade OVA.

Nezha is born able to walk and talk, and is taken on as a student of the immortal Taiyi Zhenren.\n\nThe Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, tired of being peaceful, have become cruel and destructive, plaguing China with destructive storms and a drought. The people beg for rain, but the East Sea Dragon King Ao Guang ignores them, telling the yaksha Ye Sha to go and find children for him to eat. Ye Sha captures one of Nezha\u0027s friends as he is bathing by the ocean, and Nezha confronts him, injuring him badly. Ao Guang sends his third son, Ao Bing, next. Ao Bing is killed by Nezha, infuriating Ao Guang.\n\nA variety of confrontations ensue between Nezha and Ao Guang. Ao Guang and the other Dragon Kings wreak havoc on the people, causing storms, floods and all manners of natural disasters. Seeing this, Nezha takes his father\u0027s sword, tells his parents that he is returning their flesh and bones to them, and calls out for his master before committing suicide by slitting his throat.\n\nHe is reborn with the help of his master, again from a lotus blossom, and is given new weapons and abilities. After breaking into Ao Guang\u0027s underwater palace, he confronts Ao Guang and the other Dragon Kings again, and is finally triumphant. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":6.4,"Rank":7172,"Popularity":12748,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1979,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":3510,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":50,"Completed":564,"OnHold":25,"Dropped":91,"PlanToWatch":387,"Total":1117},"Favorites":5,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Shanghai Animation Film Studio"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=9369","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T18:10:35.642+01:00"},{"Id":8786,"Title":"Inakappe Taishou","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/59671.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1970,"Month":10,"Day":4,"Full":"1970-10-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":1972,"Month":9,"Day":24,"Full":"1972-09-24"},"Synopsis":"A comedy about a country boy that travels to the city to study judo.

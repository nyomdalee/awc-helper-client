Believing that grip racing is far superior to flashy drift racing, Nakazato is dead set on defeating the AE86 to prove that he is the better racer.\n\nThanks to Itsuki Takeuchi\u0027s hasty acceptance of the match on his behalf, Takumi is reluctant to get involved with the challenge and chooses not to race, stating that he is not a racer by any means. Overseeing the dilemma, Takumi\u0027s employer goads him into accepting. However, when Takumi returns home to get the AE86, he finds that his father has taken the car out for himself. As he waits for his father\u0027s return, Takumi begins to feel his itch to race grow ever more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.82,"Rank":990,"Popularity":4076,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":3,"Name":"Racing"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":3683,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":730,"Completed":23435,"OnHold":276,"Dropped":288,"PlanToWatch":8327,"Total":33056},"Favorites":48,"Producers":["Shochiku","Kodansha","Ultra Super Pictures","Avex Pictures","Sammy"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["SANZIGEN","LIDENFILMS"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Resurrection (\u30EA\u30B6\u30EC\u30AF\u30B7\u30E7\u30F3)\u0022 by BACK-ON"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=9987","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T04:27:58.467+01:00"},{"Id":28883,"Title":"Hidan no Aria AA","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76700.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":10,"Day":6,"Full":"2015-10-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":12,"Day":22,"Full":"2015-12-22"},"Synopsis":"Akari Mamiya, a first-year student from Tokyo Butei High, idolizes the S-rank Butei Aria Holmes Kanzaki and wishes to follow in her footsteps.

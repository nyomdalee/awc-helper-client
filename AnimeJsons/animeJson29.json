Despite only being an inept E-rank Butei, Akari\u0027s resolve to improve remains strong. After the idea of having an Amica contract (a senior-student mentorship program) with Aria is brought up, Akari submits a request form attempting to establish said contract. Her classmates and friends do not expect Aria to accept Akari\u0027s request, mainly because of the girl\u0027s strict selection process, but to everyone\u0027s surprise, Aria gives Akari a chance through a test, which Akari miraculously passes! However, Aria will not officially make Akari her Amica until Akari meets her standards.\n\nTraining under Aria will be no easy feat, as she has to concurrently manage her relationships with her friends. Will Akari have what it takes to walk down the same path as her idol?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":6.22,"Rank":8103,"Popularity":2005,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"23:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":5072,"Completed":57841,"OnHold":3229,"Dropped":8394,"PlanToWatch":26623,"Total":101159},"Favorites":128,"Producers":["flying DOG","Fujishouji"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Doga Kobo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Bull\u0027s Eye\u0022 by nano"],"Endings":["\u0022Pulse (\u30D1\u30EB\u30B9)\u0022 by Team AA [Akari Mamiya (Ayane Sakura) \u0026 Aria Holmes Kanzaki (Rie Kugimiya)]"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10980","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T17:34:10.824+01:00"},{"Id":28887,"Title":"Setsuzoku Muyou","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/69699.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":12,"Day":3,"Full":"2014-12-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2015"},"Synopsis":"Short stories with no excitement, no punchline, and no connection.","Mean":null,"Rank":17483,"Popularity":19410,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"17:57"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":180,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":22,"Completed":41,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":72,"PlanToWatch":79,"Total":222},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Tokyo MX"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T17:34:12.746+01:00"},{"Id":28891,"Title":"Haikyuu!!

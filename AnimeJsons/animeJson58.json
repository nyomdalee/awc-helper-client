When the restaurant owner decides that he has had enough, he fires Mito, leaving him unemployed and with no place to call home.\n\nSoon after, Mito happens upon a cafe and receives a cut on the hand from broken glass. A strange man named Ruka Saotome takes Mito aside to presumably tend to the injury, but instead, he licks away Mito\u0027s blood, remarking that it tastes disgusting before asking Mito to leave. Later that night, Mito accidentally slips off the roof of a building and is caught by Ruka, who reveals himself to be a vampire.\n\nRuka explains that a man\u0027s blood tastes disgusting, and the blood of someone unloved has an even worse flavor. However, Ruka cannot drink from girls, so he has been looking for a beautiful boy to become his thrall. He proposes that Mito fill this role and that he allow Ruka\u0027s affections to \u0022ripen\u0022 his blood. Mito accepts and begins living with Ruka in the Hijirigaoka Boys\u0027 Academy dormitory. However, there is just one problem in all this: Mito is actually a girl!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":8355,"Genres":[{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":81,"Name":"Crossdressing"},{"Id":32,"Name":"Vampire"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":null,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Watching":1,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":4913,"Total":4914},"Favorites":24,"Producers":["Avex Pictures"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Studio Blanc."],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=18260","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T23:19:26.067+01:00"},{"Id":57032,"Title":"Let\u0027s Be Friends: Tomodachi ni Narou yo","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1725/139402.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1997,"Month":8,"Day":1,"Full":"1997-08-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1997-08-01"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Let\u0027s Be Friends: Tomodachi ni Narou yo by Manami Furukita that was featured on NHK\u0027s Minna no Uta program.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":25396,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1997,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":145,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":3,"Completed":20,"OnHold":1,"Dropped":11,"PlanToWatch":13,"Total":48},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["NHK"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T23:19:27.579+01:00"},{"Id":57033,"Title":"Boku no Plue","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1528/139403.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1977,"Month":2,"Day":4,"Full":"1977-02-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1977-02-04"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Boku no Plue by Hiromi Iwasaki that was featured on NHK\u0027s Minna no Uta program.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":23972,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1977,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":145,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":2,"Completed":25,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":17,"PlanToWatch":15,"Total":61},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["NHK","Green Camel"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T23:19:29.087+01:00"},{"Id":57034,"Title":"Ple Ple Pleiades \u00D7 Kagejitsu!","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/139404.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":10,"Day":31,"Full":"2023-10-31"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2023-10-31"},"Synopsis":"For some reason, Ainz and Shadow have swapped bodies!

But when her skills save him from being run over by a truck, Hitoyoshi ultimately decides to take her in.\n\nHowever, the mysterious girl actually has no household skills. In fact, her only expertise is assassination, as she has lived her entire life for the sake of killing. Nonetheless, her time with Hitoyoshi allows her to experience new emotions she had never felt before, inspiring her to become a regular girl.\n\nIn order to advance toward this upcoming chapter in her life, she asks Hitoyoshi to grant her a new name, to which he names her Yuki.

Although she escaped unharmed, this only made worse her insecurities. It was only because of the intervention of Dr. Chang that she was able to feel good about herself. Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang\u0027s protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sara\u0027s method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation\n\nSara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.","Mean":5.33,"Rank":null,"Popularity":10968,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":26,"Name":"Girls Love"}],"ExplicitGenres":[{"Id":12,"Name":"Hentai"}],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":2,"StartSeason":{"Year":1996,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1724,"Rating":"Rx","Statistics":{"Watching":220,"Completed":998,"OnHold":102,"Dropped":177,"PlanToWatch":1080,"Total":2577},"Favorites":3,"Producers":["GAGA"],"Licensors":["Central Park Media"],"Studios":["J.C.Staff"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=1012","LastUpdated":"2025-01-05T23:25:08.801+01:00"},{"Id":4162,"Title":"Taiho Shichau zo: Nagisa no Koutsuu Yuudou","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/21617.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1999,"Month":4,"Day":2,"Full":"1999-04-02"},"EndDate":{"Year":1999,"Month":4,"Day":2,"Full":"1999-04-02"},"Synopsis":"Summer arrives to Bokuto Station.

They crash into a black hole which is connected to another universe. The people on the ship are cast adrift in an emergency capsule to a planet called Ismo. The story begins 12 years after they have reached Ismo.\n\nIsmo is a star of the Onam System, which corresponds to the Solar System in our universe. It is the only planet left in the Onam System. The Death Star called Yomi is a comet which regularly approaches the Onam System.\n\nThere were once 8 planets in the Onam System. Many years ago, in the time of the gods, there was a war against the evil monster Yamatano Orochi (an 8-headed snake-like creature). The gods won the battle. Yamatano Orochi was locked into 8 stones, one of which is buried deep in the center of each planet. Nobody was supposed to have access to the core of the planets. However Tsukuyomi, an evil god who rules Yomi, succeeded in reaching the stones one after another, destroying 7 of the planets using his powerful robots, the Sky Warriors. However, when he tried to acquire the last stone from the planet Ismo, the most powerful Sky Warrior, Susanoo, got out of control and was blown away.\n\nA million years later, the Death Star Yomi is approaching the Onam System once again. Tsukuyomi, the master of Yomi, plans to take this opportunity to realize his dream of ruling the entire universe. He is desperate for the last stone containing Yamatano Orochi. If Tsukuyomi can get hold of this stone, Yamatano Orochi will return to life and its power will become his. Tsukuyomi needs Sky Warrior Susanoo to capture the stone, and sends 8 Sky Soldiers to get Susanoo back. But it is too late. Susanoo no longer belongs to Tsukuyomi. It belongs to Takeru, a 13-year-old boy from Earth, who happened to discover the buried robot Susanoo and woke it from its million-year-long sleep. Takeru becomes involved in the battle against the Sky Soldiers and their evil master, Tsukuyomi. Susanoo stands up to protect his friends and their planet.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","Mean":6.67,"Rank":6037,"Popularity":10523,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"},{"Id":29,"Name":"Space"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":37,"StartSeason":{"Year":1994,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"17:30"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":184,"Completed":948,"OnHold":104,"Dropped":180,"PlanToWatch":1524,"Total":2940},"Favorites":11,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Nippon Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Manatsu no Tobira (\u771F\u590F\u306E\u6249; Door to Midsummer)\u0022 by GLAY (eps 1-18)","2: \u0022Flower of Desert\u0022 by Naoko Hamasaki (\u6FF1\u5D0E\u76F4\u5B50) (eps 19-37)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Rain\u0022 by GLAY (eps 1-18)","2: \u0022Twilight Songs\u0022 by Naoko Hamasaki (eps 19-37)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=2311","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T03:32:36.554+01:00"},{"Id":4774,"Title":"Ningyou Tsukai","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/9218.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1996,"Month":5,"Day":21,"Full":"1996-05-21"},"EndDate":{"Year":1996,"Month":5,"Day":21,"Full":"1996-05-21"},"Synopsis":"Silhouettes are robots controlled by human thoughts, originally created to help mankind.

Yuuno is not powerful enough to capture the Jewel seeds on his own, so he grants Nanoha the intelligent device \u0022Raising Heart\u0022 and begins training her as a mage.  \n\nUnfortunately, the powerful Jewel Seeds attract those with ill intentions. Another mage, Fate Testarossa, is desperate to collect the seeds for some unknown and sinister purpose, though the solemn look in her eyes makes Nanoha think that there is more to Fate than meets the eye. Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st is a retelling of the original series, which tells the story of two young mages and how their strong emotions shape their actions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.86,"Rank":899,"Popularity":4126,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":66,"Name":"Mahou Shoujo"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2010,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":7800,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":681,"Completed":21458,"OnHold":423,"Dropped":362,"PlanToWatch":9331,"Total":32255},"Favorites":193,"Producers":["Aniplex"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Seven Arcs"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["1: \u0022My wish My love\u0022 by Yukari Tamura","2: \u0022PHANTOM MINDS\u0022 by Nana Mizuki"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6075","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T03:36:45.725+01:00"},{"Id":4991,"Title":"Wakakusa Monogatari","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/60945.webp","StartDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":5,"Day":3,"Full":"1980-05-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":5,"Day":3,"Full":"1980-05-03"},"Synopsis":"This is a TV special based on the novel, Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott.

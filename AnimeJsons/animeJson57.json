Kiyomine and Kei Kaname were once recognized as the most formidable pitcher-catcher duo in middle school baseball. Known as the \u0022General,\u0022 Kaname paired his expert strategies with Kiyomine\u0027s explosive pitches, crushing the dreams of many starry-eyed players who hoped to one day make it to the big leagues.\n\nHigh school freshman Tarou Yamada is one such former player. Having given up on competing, he enrolls in Kotesashi High School\u2014a completely average public school with no baseball team to speak of\u2014where he discovers that his new classmates are the legendary pair who once destroyed his dreams. Adding to this shocking revelation, he learns that amnesia has reduced the once level-headed General to a vulgar class clown. Having lost all interest in baseball, Kaname dragged a disappointed Kiyomine to Kotesashi simply because the school was close to where they live.\n\nAs Kotesashi forms a fledgling baseball club, Yamada meets other players he once admired who also left baseball behind. While they might be unwilling now, Yamada believes that if he can convince such talented athletes to start playing again, it might be possible to achieve their dreams and win the national championship\u2014as long as they can put up with Kaname\u0027s incessant joking.\n\n[Written by MAL

Soutarou subcontracts the gig to Saki, but soon enough regrets it when the kid also goes missing.

But it is the duke\u0027s flirty maid, Alice Lendrott, who fills him with the promise of a beautiful tomorrow and the determination to break this hellish spell cast upon him.\n\nThe identity of the witch who cursed the duke has been uncovered thanks to Zain\u0027s unique magic and the help of Daleth, the leader of the underworld. However, the villain is a notoriously fearsome and powerful witch, who, enraged by the duke and his companions\u0027 trip back in time, torments them even from the afterlife. Moreover, an unexpected loved one reappears, strengthening the duke and Alice\u0027s hope to break the curse and finally close the distance between them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.14,"Rank":466,"Popularity":3070,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":74,"Name":"Love Status Quo"},{"Id":82,"Name":"Urban Fantasy"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":5226,"Completed":26385,"OnHold":1086,"Dropped":811,"PlanToWatch":23115,"Total":56623},"Favorites":243,"Producers":["Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","Shogakukan Music \u0026 Digital Entertainment","NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","BS11","Shogakukan","Yomiuri TV Enterprise","Bandai Spirits"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["J.C.Staff"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Cinematic Parade (\u30B7\u30CD\u30DE\u30C6\u30A3\u30C3\u30AF\u30D1\u30EC\u30FC\u30C9)\u0022 by Nasuo\u2606"],"Endings":["1: \u0022\u00C9toile Memoir (\u30A8\u30C8\u30EF\u30FC\u30EB\u30E1\u30E2\u30EF\u30FC\u30EB)\u0022 by Alice (CV: Ayumi Mano)","2: \u0022Nocturne (\u591C\u60F3\u66F2)\u0022 by Alice (CV: Ayumi Mano) (eps 11)","3: \u0022Mangetsu to Silhouette no Yoru (Wedding Ver.)

the Kingdom of Yamauchi, people have the ability to transform into three-legged crows known as yatagarasu. While the men plot over daily governance, women compete for the hand of Wakamiya, the crown prince who was selected as the Kinu, the servant to the Mountain God. Four young women arrive at the court to join the competition, including one named Asebi.\n\nWhile the kind and innocent Asebi sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the other women, the crown prince has to fight for his place in the clan. Despite being born both to a concubine and as a second son, the royal priests still chose Wakamiya to be the Kinu over his older brother. This decision created a rift between the siblings while enraging Wakamiya\u0027s stepmother in the process. \n\nWhen Yukiya, one of the teenage sons of the village chief, is sent to the palace to become Wakamiya\u0027s new attendant, the prince  is not pleased in the slightest. However, Yukiya\u0027s presence at the imperial courts is no mere coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.06,"Rank":578,"Popularity":3507,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":20,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"23:45"},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":8795,"Completed":13275,"OnHold":1192,"Dropped":1777,"PlanToWatch":19452,"Total":44491},"Favorites":376,"Producers":["NHK","NHK Enterprises"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Pierrot"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022poi\u0022 by Saucy Dog"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Tokoshie (\u3068\u3053\u3057\u3048)\u0022 by Akiko Shikata (eps 1-19)","2: \u0022poi\u0022 by Saucy Dog (eps 20)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=18253","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T17:27:21.343+01:00"},{"Id":56981,"Title":"Shi Fang Wu Sheng","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1499/139309.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":11,"Day":10,"Full":"2023-11-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":2,"Day":16,"Full":"2024-02-16"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":6.86,"Rank":4973,"Popularity":14722,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":17,"Name":"Martial Arts"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":16,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Web Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1117,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":169,"Completed":391,"OnHold":32,"Dropped":67,"PlanToWatch":186,"Total":845},"Favorites":2,"Producers":["bilibili"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T17:27:23.971+01:00"},{"Id":56982,"Title":"Suteki na Yume wo","Picture":null,"StartDate":{"Year":1965,"Month":10,"Day":null,"Full":"1965-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":1965,"Month":10,"Day":null,"Full":"1965-10"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Suteki na Yume wo by the Mieko Hirota and the NHK Tokyo Jidou Gasshoudan that was featured on NHK\u0027s Minna no Uta program.

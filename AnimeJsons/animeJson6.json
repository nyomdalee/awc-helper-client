The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank\u0027s treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).\n\nThe employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun\u0027s mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power.\n\nAnother tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Force\u2014the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret.\n\nAfter the MBT-99\u0027s hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank (owned by the same corporation that built the first bank in the movie), and various collateral damage.","Mean":5.42,"Rank":11470,"Popularity":11363,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":39,"Name":"Detective"},{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":4700,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":62,"Completed":880,"OnHold":27,"Dropped":96,"PlanToWatch":571,"Total":1636},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Studio Nue"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Artmic"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=1862","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.6825988Z"},{"Id":5091,"Title":"Manga Sarutobi Sasuke","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/57257.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1979,"Month":10,"Day":9,"Full":"1979-10-09"},"EndDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":4,"Day":15,"Full":"1980-04-15"},"Synopsis":"Sasuke is the story of a ninja child that starts right after the battle of Sekigahara where Tokugawa Ieyasu becomes shogun of Japan.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu\u0027s Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei\u0027s Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao\u0027s perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":7.23,"Rank":2958,"Popularity":4797,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1380,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":1525,"Completed":4333,"OnHold":1093,"Dropped":1210,"PlanToWatch":10520,"Total":18681},"Favorites":47,"Producers":["VAP"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Madhouse"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022909\u0022 by Tribal Chair"],"Endings":["\u0022Pinhole\u0022 by Ogre You Asshole"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6408","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.684514Z"},{"Id":5228,"Title":"Initial D Extra Stage 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10462.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":10,"Day":3,"Full":"2008-10-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2008-10-03"},"Synopsis":"Dissatisfied with Impact Blue\u0027s growing reputation as the fastest racer on Mount Usui, Mako Satou decides to break out of her mold and dedicate her time toward becoming a professional racer.

After his mother gives him the glove his father used, Doumu makes that shot in a training session of the Giants and is contracted immediately. With the support of the veteran players of the team, the Giants become unbeatable at home- none of the main batters of the Japanese professional league can overcome his magic shot.

The Giants seem to winning the fight to conquer the league- until the arrival of the mysterious Don Carlos, a Spanish ex-bullfighter who plays for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, and seems to have a past with Doumu\u0027s father.

Rui begins to doubt herself after hearing Nodame\u0027s playing and being denied tutelage from Auclair; Maestro Franz von Stresemann faces the reality of his mortality; pianists Yunlong Li and Tatiana Vishneva feverishly prepare for a competition, while the latter also struggles with her growing feelings for oboist and fellow student Yasunori Kuroki. \n\nAs Chiaki, Nodame, and their friends continue on their respective journeys, they must not only strive to stay true to themselves, but also remember where it all started.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.23,"Rank":311,"Popularity":1673,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":43,"Name":"Josei"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":11,"StartSeason":{"Year":2010,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:45"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1374,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":3271,"Completed":89959,"OnHold":1981,"Dropped":1143,"PlanToWatch":29527,"Total":125881},"Favorites":406,"Producers":["Dentsu","Genco","SKY Perfect Well Think","Kodansha","Fuji TV","Asmik Ace","Sony Music Entertainment"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["J.C.Staff"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Manazashi \u2606 Daydream (\u307E\u306A\u3056\u3057\u2606\u30C7\u30A4\u30C9\u30EA\u30FC\u30E0)\u0022 by Yuu Sakai (\u3055\u304B\u3044\u3086\u3046)"],"Endings":["\u0022Kaze to Oka no Ballad (\u98A8\u3068\u4E18\u306E\u30D0\u30E9\u30FC\u30C9)\u0022 by Real Paradis with Nodame Orchestra"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=7019","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.6902516Z"},{"Id":5691,"Title":"Rekka no Honoo: Final Burning","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1612/127105.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2004,"Month":6,"Day":10,"Full":"2004-06-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2004-06-10"},"Synopsis":"This episode explains why the title of the series is \u0022Flame of Recca\u0022.

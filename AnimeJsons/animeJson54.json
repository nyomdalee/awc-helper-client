All she wants is to be able to make friends and find love without being defined by her connection to the yakuza.\n\nBut Isaku\u0027s dreams are thwarted when her overprotective caretaker, 26-year-old Keiya Utou, takes it upon himself to enroll in Isaku\u0027s school by bribing the school administration.

the near future, 10 percent of the population will consist of Humanoids\u2014machines with advanced functions and artificial intelligence resembling human personalities, easily recognized by their sideways pupils. These specialized patients likewise require a special doctor. By day, Dr. Hikaru Sudou runs a medical clinic for Humanoids; by night, under the moniker of Moggadeet, he performs illegal procedures and gathers information about his lost mother.\n\nHikaru encounters patients with varying problems unique to this society: a Humanoid struggling with the question of whether she and the source of her backup data are the same person, a teenage Humanoid who cannot improve athletically, and even a robot teddy bear with memories of multiple owners. As the world\u0027s technology constantly evolves, newer and more complex questions surrounding humanity arise. With each new advance, it becomes more difficult to define what truly makes one human or Humanoid.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.57,"Rank":6196,"Popularity":3381,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"01:53"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1466,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":6503,"Completed":11672,"OnHold":1436,"Dropped":5117,"PlanToWatch":16316,"Total":41044},"Favorites":111,"Producers":["Mainichi Broadcasting System","Nikkatsu","Akita Shoten","Nichion","Bit grooove promotion","Hero Garage"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Madhouse"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022No Frontier\u0022 by Aile The Shota"],"Endings":["\u0022Wasurenagusa (\u52FF\u5FD8\u8349)\u0022 by GReeeeN"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17758","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T23:57:04.298+01:00"},{"Id":53788,"Title":"Cycle Race","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1422/131693.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2021"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021"},"Synopsis":"A short film by Hiroki Kurasawa.","Mean":null,"Rank":18804,"Popularity":23154,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":304,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":12,"Completed":28,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":17,"PlanToWatch":15,"Total":74},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T23:57:06.889+01:00"},{"Id":53789,"Title":"32","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1498/131694.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":2,"Day":14,"Full":"2021-02-14"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021-02-14"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song 32 by Kouji Takahashi.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":20278,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":112,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":5,"Completed":131,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":18,"PlanToWatch":14,"Total":171},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T23:57:07.897+01:00"},{"Id":53790,"Title":"Parallax","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1659/131695.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2021"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021"},"Synopsis":"A film by Hayato Nove.","Mean":null,"Rank":16824,"Popularity":22298,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1988,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":7,"Completed":30,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":15,"PlanToWatch":32,"Total":87},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T23:57:09.541+01:00"},{"Id":53791,"Title":"Jidousha ni Natta Kame no Uta","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1872/131696.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1973,"Month":8,"Day":1,"Full":"1973-08-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1973-08-01"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Jidousha ni Natta Kame no Uta by Seiji Tanaka and Sakamoto Children\u0027s Choir.

Many of the surviving Soul Reaper captains train to battle without their Bankai, the ultimate technique wielded by the fiercest warriors.\n\nIn the previous assault, Ichigo Kurosaki narrowly managed to help fend off Yhwach\u0027s fearsome wrath. However, to ultimately defeat his godly adversary and save his allies, Ichigo must now undergo severe training that will push him beyond his physical, emotional, and mental limits.\n\nThough Yhwach already holds the upper hand in this ongoing blood feud, he also successfully recruits Uryuu Ishida, Ichigo\u0027s close friend and rival, to be his successor. Yhwach strikes out once again at the weakened Soul Society, intent on finally obliterating his long-standing enemies. As Ichigo struggles to attain new power, the Soul Reaper captains fight for survival and borrowed time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.71,"Rank":52,"Popularity":989,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"23:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1465,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":46151,"Completed":126182,"OnHold":2061,"Dropped":1137,"PlanToWatch":61399,"Total":236930},"Favorites":3796,"Producers":["TV Tokyo","Aniplex","Dentsu","Shueisha","Zack Promotion"],"Licensors":["VIZ Media"],"Studios":["Pierrot"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022STARS\u0022 by w.o.d.

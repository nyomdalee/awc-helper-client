2242, the remnants of humanity are forced to live in scattered bubble-like cities across devastated lands. Hiding from toxic rain and hostile lifeforms known as Enders, they survive thanks to a new source of energy from AO crystals.

Now preparing to enter high school, Isaku is determined to start fresh with an honest attempt at having a normal high school experience. All she wants is to be able to make friends and find love without being defined by her connection to the yakuza.\n\nBut Isaku\u0027s dreams are thwarted when her overprotective caretaker, 26-year-old Keiya Utou, takes it upon himself to enroll in Isaku\u0027s school by bribing the school administration. While Isaku yearns for a reciprocated love, she is trapped in a one-sided infatuation with Keiya, who only sees her as the boss\u0027s granddaughter he helped raise. Her longing for a normal life becomes a constant battle, and breaking free from her heart\u0027s grip is far more challenging than it sounds, as Keiya\u0027s overprotectiveness and disregard for her boundaries make it almost impossible to move on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":5.66,"Rank":11488,"Popularity":2570,"Genres":[{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":68,"Name":"Organized Crime"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1419,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":9905,"Completed":27325,"OnHold":2102,"Dropped":11807,"PlanToWatch":26379,"Total":77518},"Favorites":506,"Producers":["Yomiuri Telecasting","Pony Canyon","Kodansha","Crunchyroll","Bit grooove promotion","BS Asahi","CHOCOLATE"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Project No.9"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Suki ni Naccha Dame na Hito (\u597D\u304D\u306B\u306A\u3063\u3061\u3083\u30C0\u30E1\u306A\u4EBA)\u0022 by Masayoshi Ooishi (\u30AA\u30FC\u30A4\u30B7\u30DE\u30B5\u30E8\u30B7)"],"Endings":["\u0022Magie\u00D7Magie\u0022 by Akari Kitou (\u9B3C\u982D\u660E\u91CC)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17666","LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:33:12.209+01:00"},{"Id":53314,"Title":"Banana Chips","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1989/129029.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1998"},"EndDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1998"},"Synopsis":"Music video directed by artist Yoshitomo Nara for the song Banana Chips by punk band Shonen Knife.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":21952,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":175,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":6,"Completed":118,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":18,"PlanToWatch":24,"Total":166},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:33:14.909+01:00"},{"Id":53315,"Title":"Bakuon Otoko: Bommerman","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1941/129030.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":1,"Day":6,"Full":"2011-01-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":1,"Day":6,"Full":"2011-01-06"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Bakuon Otoko: Bommerman by Shouan no Kaze.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":22847,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":340,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":5,"Completed":84,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":16,"PlanToWatch":25,"Total":132},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:33:17.104+01:00"},{"Id":53316,"Title":"Pocket no Naka","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/129031.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":8,"Day":24,"Full":"2022-08-24"},"EndDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":8,"Day":24,"Full":"2022-08-24"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Pocket no Naka by Quruli.

the near future, 10 percent of the population will consist of Humanoids\u2014machines with advanced functions and artificial intelligence resembling human personalities, easily recognized by their sideways pupils. These specialized patients likewise require a special doctor. By day, Dr. Hikaru Sudou runs a medical clinic for Humanoids; by night, under the moniker of Moggadeet, he performs illegal procedures and gathers information about his lost mother.\n\nHikaru encounters patients with varying problems unique to this society: a Humanoid struggling with the question of whether she and the source of her backup data are the same person, a teenage Humanoid who cannot improve athletically, and even a robot teddy bear with memories of multiple owners. As the world\u0027s technology constantly evolves, newer and more complex questions surrounding humanity arise. With each new advance, it becomes more difficult to define what truly makes one human or Humanoid.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.53,"Rank":6827,"Popularity":3371,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"01:53"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1466,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":5365,"Completed":15487,"OnHold":2001,"Dropped":6569,"PlanToWatch":17815,"Total":47237},"Favorites":123,"Producers":["Mainichi Broadcasting System","Nikkatsu","Akita Shoten","Nichion","Bit grooove promotion","Hero Garage"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Madhouse"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022No Frontier\u0022 by Aile The Shota"],"Endings":["\u0022Wasurenagusa (\u52FF\u5FD8\u8349)\u0022 by GReeeeN"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17758","LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:43:18.034+01:00"},{"Id":53788,"Title":"Cycle Race","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1422/131693.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021"},"Synopsis":"A short film by Hiroki Kurasawa.","Mean":null,"Rank":19856,"Popularity":24215,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":304,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":14,"Completed":37,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":22,"PlanToWatch":24,"Total":100},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:43:21.196+01:00"},{"Id":53789,"Title":"32","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1498/131694.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":2,"Day":14,"Full":"2021-02-14"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":2,"Day":14,"Full":"2021-02-14"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song 32 by Kouji Takahashi.","Mean":5.44,"Rank":null,"Popularity":20796,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":112,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":5,"Completed":177,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":25,"PlanToWatch":21,"Total":228},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:43:23.346+01:00"},{"Id":53790,"Title":"Parallax","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1659/131695.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021"},"Synopsis":"A film by Hayato Nove.","Mean":null,"Rank":18224,"Popularity":23223,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1988,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":8,"Completed":39,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":17,"PlanToWatch":53,"Total":119},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:43:25.698+01:00"},{"Id":53791,"Title":"Jidousha ni Natta Kame no Uta","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1872/131696.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1973,"Month":8,"Day":1,"Full":"1973-08-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":1973,"Month":8,"Day":1,"Full":"1973-08-01"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Jidousha ni Natta Kame no Uta by Seiji Tanaka and Sakamoto Children\u0027s Choir.

Ascending the tower is no easy task; for decades, no one has overcome the array of traps, puzzles, and enemies designed to repulse any challengers. Oscar, however, easily climbs to the top, where he meets the fabled witch, Tinasha. To the prince\u0027s surprise, despite being hundreds of years old, Tinasha looks like a beautiful young woman in her late teens.\n\nOscar explains his circumstances to the witch, who quickly perceives the true nature of his affliction.

Many of the surviving Soul Reaper captains train to battle without their Bankai, the ultimate technique wielded by the fiercest warriors.\n\nIn the previous assault, Ichigo Kurosaki narrowly managed to help fend off Yhwach\u0027s fearsome wrath. However, to ultimately defeat his godly adversary and save his allies, Ichigo must now undergo severe training that will push him beyond his physical, emotional, and mental limits.\n\nThough Yhwach already holds the upper hand in this ongoing blood feud, he also successfully recruits Uryuu Ishida, Ichigo\u0027s close friend and rival, to be his successor. Yhwach strikes out once again at the weakened Soul Society, intent on finally obliterating his long-standing enemies. As Ichigo struggles to attain new power, the Soul Reaper captains fight for survival and borrowed time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.7,"Rank":60,"Popularity":777,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"23:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1465,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":35956,"Completed":223356,"OnHold":3171,"Dropped":1650,"PlanToWatch":63888,"Total":328021},"Favorites":4678,"Producers":["TV Tokyo","Aniplex","Dentsu","Shueisha","Zack Promotion"],"Licensors":["VIZ Media"],"Studios":["Pierrot"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022STARS\u0022 by w.o.d.

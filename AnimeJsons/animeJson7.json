Bizarre, comical, heartwarming and threatening characters come together in a series of battles that push the powers and abilities of Gokuu and his friends beyond anything they have ever experienced.","Mean":7.76,"Rank":1119,"Popularity":600,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":17,"Name":"Martial Arts"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":97,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"09:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1405,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":21618,"Completed":327177,"OnHold":11062,"Dropped":13688,"PlanToWatch":34377,"Total":407922},"Favorites":3643,"Producers":["Fuji TV"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Dragon Soul\u0022 by Tanimoto Takeyoshi"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Yeah!

Together with the Priestess of the Sky, she has the power to seal Sedna away again. And as luck would have it, during an encounter with one of Sedna\u0027s minions, Kanon discovers that she is the Priestess of the Sky.

As a reward, Arceus created the Jewel of Life and gave it to the people of Michina Town, stipulating that it must be returned, but the humans refused, hogging the Jewel to themselves. In the battle that ensued, Damon was killed and Arceus went into slumber, vowing to punish humanity upon its return.\n\nSatoshi and his companions arrive in Michina Town where they come across Sheena, a descendant of Damon, who claims to be in possession of the Jewel of Life and intends on giving it back to Arceus when it awakens.\n\nThe situation takes an unexpected turn when Arceus, despite Sheena\u0027s best intentions, remains unsatisfied. Satoshi must now prevent the destruction of the entire human race, as Arceus\u0027 fury causes distortions in the fabric of the universe, enraging the Legendary trio\u2014Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina\u2014and disturbing the world\u0027s balance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.04,"Rank":4181,"Popularity":2309,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":5640,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":652,"Completed":85287,"OnHold":332,"Dropped":362,"PlanToWatch":5522,"Total":92155},"Favorites":29,"Producers":[],"Licensors":["VIZ Media","The Pokemon Company International"],"Studios":["OLM"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Kokoro no Antenna\u0022 by Shoko Nakagawa"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6316","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T04:01:57.932+01:00"},{"Id":6181,"Title":"Highway Jenny","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/52723.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":9,"Day":27,"Full":"2006-09-27"},"EndDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":9,"Day":27,"Full":"2006-09-27"},"Synopsis":"Various places in the world, trouble is awakening the terror inside every person\u0027s view of life, the distant future of overhead airspace is shown in \u0022Highway Jenny.\u0022\n\n It compares existence with one\u0027s lifetime and afterlife, it contemplates the purity and death of future generations, and to the person who looks at the importance of the choices in their own life, it will be appealing.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","Mean":5.12,"Rank":12954,"Popularity":12439,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2006,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1680,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":72,"Completed":832,"OnHold":39,"Dropped":69,"PlanToWatch":621,"Total":1633},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=4609","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T04:02:00.094+01:00"},{"Id":6182,"Title":"Maihime","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/13677.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":8,"Day":1,"Full":"2006-08-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":8,"Day":1,"Full":"2006-08-01"},"Synopsis":"A lonely exchange student meets and falls in passionate love with a dancer.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation\u0027s Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \n\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku\u0027s Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \n\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast. \n\n(Source: Pelleas)","Mean":6.15,"Rank":9057,"Popularity":11647,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1471,"StartSeason":{"Year":1976,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Unknown","StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":101,"Completed":1052,"OnHold":105,"Dropped":235,"PlanToWatch":622,"Total":2115},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Group TAC"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Nippon mukashibanashi\u0022 by Hanazukin"],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=3588","LastUpdated":"2025-01-05T23:30:47.753+01:00"},{"Id":6280,"Title":"Cat Shit One","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1006/116460.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":7,"Day":17,"Full":"2010-07-17"},"EndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":7,"Day":17,"Full":"2010-07-17"},"Synopsis":"The Carrot Military Service special unit, Cat Shit One, is an elite private military fighting force.

Though she has the appearance of an adult, Gel Sadra is not immune to throwing childish tantrums and behaving immaturely.\n\nIn the midst of the revival of Galactor, the Science Ninja Team is called back into action, with a shady man known as Hawk Getz acting as the replacement for Joe. Getz is quickly revealed to be a Galactor agent in disguise (and had killed the actual Getz who was to join), and winds up killed by a mysterious feather shuriken. After hints spread in the first three episodes, Joe reappears in the fourth episode, having somehow survived his fatal injuries at the end of the first series, and rejoins the team. It is later revealed that he was rescued by an ex-Galactor scientist at the brink of his death, and was the subject of various cybernetic augmentations.\n\nLater in the series, a female scientist known as Dr.Pandora is introduced, who had lost her husband and daughter in the cruise ship disaster. Unbeknown to her, her daughter Sammie survived and is in fact Gel Sadra.","Mean":6.47,"Rank":7239,"Popularity":10560,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":52,"StartSeason":{"Year":1978,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Unknown","StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1418,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":169,"Completed":1259,"OnHold":93,"Dropped":203,"PlanToWatch":1184,"Total":2908},"Favorites":6,"Producers":[],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks","Saban Entertainment"],"Studios":["Tatsunoko Production"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Warera Gatchaman (\u308F\u308C\u3089\u30AC\u30C3\u30C1\u30E3\u30DE\u30F3)\u0022 by Isao Sasaki and Columbia Yurikago Kai"],"Endings":["\u0022Ashita Yume Mite (\u660E\u65E5\u5922\u307F\u3066)\u0022 by Isao Sasaki and Mitsuko Horie"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=1449","LastUpdated":"2025-01-05T23:30:58.866+01:00"},{"Id":6375,"Title":"Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman F","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/45630.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1979,"Month":10,"Day":7,"Full":"1979-10-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":8,"Day":31,"Full":"1980-08-31"},"Synopsis":"After Leader X is seemingly destroyed for good at the end of Gatchaman II, a fragment of him that survived grows and mutates into Z.

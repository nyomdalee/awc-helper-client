Now orphaned, Hajime is taken in by his uncle, who is an astronomer. There at his uncle\u0027s observatory, he meets a girl he\u0027s seen before and developed somewhat of a crush on. He finds out her name is Yukino Yayoi, and her parents run a ramen shop in town. But even better than that, she\u0027s his uncle\u0027s assistant! What luck! \n\nBut Yayoi isn\u0027t exactly what she seems. There is a reason she helps out Amamori-san at the observatory. She is the Millennial Queen (Sen-Nen Joou), specially chosen by her home planet, LaMetal, to go to Earth and help prepare for the possible annihilation of the planet. What will cause this disaster? LaMetal has an extremely elliptical orbit, which sends it very, very near Earth every 1000 years. When it gets close enough, the earth reacts, causing all sorts of natural disasters. Although she was chosen with the idea of protecting LaMetal in mind, her personal plan is to evacuate as many humans as she can to LaMetal, so if their planet is destroyed, they will survive. \n\nHowever, there is one person who strives to stop her plan, the head of the Millennial Theives. Why does he want to stop Yayoi?

When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend\u0027s daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth\u0027s strongest martial arts clan. \n\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth.

Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi\u0027s square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn\u0027t have the foggiest idea who she actually is. \n\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge/assassinate him.

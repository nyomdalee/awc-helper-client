When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend\u0027s daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth\u0027s strongest martial arts clan. \n\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi\u0027s self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi\u0027s square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn\u0027t have the foggiest idea who she actually is. \n\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge/assassinate him.

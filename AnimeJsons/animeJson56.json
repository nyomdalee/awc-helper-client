Chidori Amagami, head priest of the Amagami Shrine, allows him to stay at the Amagami residence. However, Uryuu has to live there with Chidori\u0027s three granddaughters\u2014Yae, Yuna, and Asahi\u2014who serve as shrine maidens. Moreover, Chidori has another condition for Uryuu: he has to marry one of the sisters to ensure the shrine\u0027s future and one day inherit it. But with Uryuu\u0027s goals and outlook naturally clashing against the sisters\u0027 beliefs, this already daunting ordeal seems outright impossible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.04,"Rank":4151,"Popularity":2892,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Currently Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":32786,"Completed":42,"OnHold":1372,"Dropped":3195,"PlanToWatch":26366,"Total":63761},"Favorites":252,"Producers":["Kodansha","KlockWorx","King Records","Crunchyroll","BS NTV"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Drive"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Yawaku Koishite ~Zutto Bokura de Iraremasu You ni ~ (\u3084\u308F\u304F\u604B\u3057\u3066 \uFF5E\u305A\u3063\u3068\u50D5\u3089\u3067\u3044\u3089\u308C\u307E\u3059\u3088\u3046\u306B\uFF5E)\u0022 by Momoiro Clover Z"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Kimi ni Koi wo Musunde (\u541B\u306B\u604B\u3092\u7D50\u3093\u3067)\u0022 by Yae Amagami (CV: Sumire Uesaka), Yuna Amagami (CV: Kaede Hondo), Asahi Amagami (CV: Shion Wakayama)","2: \u0022Kamisama no Iu To\u2013ri!

an assassin who works in organized crime, has been raised to the legendary status of a ruthless killer capable of murdering any man within six seconds. Six years after his debut, his boss fears that Fable has started to attract too much attention from the legal authorities, and he orders him to hide in Osaka for a year. Accompanied by his driver who assumes the identity of his sister, Fable is bound by a special condition: he must act as a civilian and not murder anyone lest he and his partner lose their lives.\n\nHowever, the seemingly well-deserved holiday soon takes a grim turn. Takeshi Ebihara, the second-in-command of the Osaka mafia that officially protects the assassin, sees Fable\u0027s presence as a threat and wants to remove him. Constantly monitored by the yakuza and regularly put in life-or-death situations, Fable has no other choice but to outwit Takeshi\u0027s schemes if he wants to stay alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.08,"Rank":539,"Popularity":2727,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":68,"Name":"Organized Crime"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":25,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"00:55"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1371,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":14978,"Completed":22733,"OnHold":2064,"Dropped":3742,"PlanToWatch":27033,"Total":70550},"Favorites":496,"Producers":["VAP","Kodansha","Nippon Television Network","Audio Planning U"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Tezuka Productions"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Professionalism\u0022 by ALI feat.

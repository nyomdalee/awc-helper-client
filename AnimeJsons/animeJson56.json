are in a bygone era when those who lurked in the shadows and carried out espionage and assassination missions, the shinobi, held power. A female ninja, a kunoichi named Ajisai, was investigating a series of mysterious disappearances. She was doing well until she infiltrated a mansion, where she was captured after making a small mistake. \u0022Oh no, I have to escape somehow,\u0022 she thought.But for Ajisai, who hoped for a chance to escape, a fate worse than death awaited. With her senses heightened by an aphrodisiac, she is subjected to a variety of tortures and sexual pleasures using different instruments. A carnal pleasure she does not desire begins to be imprinted on her slowly trained body to please men. However, her hell continues. How much can the trained ninja Ajisai endure? The kunoichi, whose expression remains unmoved despite the situation, begins to lose control of her body.

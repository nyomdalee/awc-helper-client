While lamenting the prospect of living an ordinary life, he is suddenly drawn into the world of Mato: an alternate dimension filled with dangerous monsters called Shuuki. Over the years since the existence of Mato was first confirmed, incidents of people accidentally wandering into the other world have become commonplace. To combat the threat of the Shuuki and rescue victims like Yuuki, the all-female Demon Defense Force was established. Its members have been blessed with the power of \u0022Peaches\u0022\u2014Mato fruits that grant supernatural abilities only to women.\n\nThough Yuuki\u0027s situation is dire, he is saved in the nick of time by Kyouka Uzen, the chief of the Demon Defense Force\u0027s seventh unit. Despite Kyouka\u0027s impeccable skills in battle, she has long been held back by her Peach-granted ability, Slave. Slave allows Kyouka to put a living being under her control and draw out its strength, but the Shuuki that she had enslaved until now had all proven to be exceedingly weak.\n\nWhen Yuuki and Kyouka become surrounded by a horde of Shuuki, Kyouka resorts to something she has never tried before: using her ability on a man. To her surprise, Yuuki\u0027s slave form is much more powerful than she could have imagined.

To do so, the Four Divine Kings must break four seals located in four different kingdoms.\n\nTargeted for its seal, the kingdom of Metallicana struggles to repel the army commanded by the Four Divine Kings.

Left with no other choice, Yoko successfully releases Dark Schneider, whose twisted personality has not changed over the years. As the fate of the world depends on where his allegiance lies, Yoko seems to be the only person who has some control over the powerful magician. But convincing Dark Schneider to turn against his old allies and protect those Yoko holds dear may prove to be an impossible feat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.6,"Rank":6415,"Popularity":2619,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"}],"Themes":[{"Id":58,"Name":"Gore"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1431,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":8809,"Completed":37073,"OnHold":2656,"Dropped":5762,"PlanToWatch":20684,"Total":74984},"Favorites":305,"Producers":["Warner Bros.

This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same.

His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he\u0027s delighted when his female pen pal says she\u0027ll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track.

He is left with a mystery on his hands as to the nature of the Data Drain and why Azure Kite is in possession of such a skill.\n\nEventually Haseo gains the \u0022Avatar\u0022 of Skeith. Acquiring the ability to call Skeith and wield his abilities, such as Data Drain. With Skeith as his strength, Haseo begins the quest for a way to save Shino.\n\nHe is seen seeking out a PK (Player Killer) known as Tri-Edge, whose victims supposedly are unable to return to The World after he PKs them. Haseo\u0027s friend, Shino, was attacked six months prior to the events of the game by Tri-Edge, and the player herself, Shino Nanao, was left in a coma.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":7.07,"Rank":3814,"Popularity":3797,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":79,"Name":"Video Game"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":5580,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":638,"Completed":21808,"OnHold":422,"Dropped":504,"PlanToWatch":9273,"Total":32645},"Favorites":104,"Producers":["Bandai Visual"],"Licensors":["Funimation","Bandai Entertainment"],"Studios":["CyberConnect2"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Deepest Memories\u0022 by Lien"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=5459","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T17:05:17.642+01:00"},{"Id":3270,"Title":"IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix (2005)","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5176.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2005,"Month":10,"Day":6,"Full":"2005-10-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":1,"Day":18,"Full":"2006-01-18"},"Synopsis":"In the year 2048, people are raving about a fighting race called \u201CImmortal Grand Prix\u201D, or IGPX in short, which is faster and more exciting than any of the existing motor sports.

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\n\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \u0022the Metal.\u0022\n\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\n\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual\u0027s consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.\n\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.\n\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)","Mean":7.09,"Rank":3737,"Popularity":4160,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2008,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"00:59"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1354,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":1915,"Completed":6001,"OnHold":1593,"Dropped":2206,"PlanToWatch":15288,"Total":27003},"Favorites":52,"Producers":["VAP","Nippon Television Network","D.N.

When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend\u0027s daughter.

For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge him.

The Earth is in a time of prosperity. The president of the Terran League (the \u0022Galaxy Alliance\u0022 in Voltron) launches a mission to explore beyond the galaxy. After commencing its mission of exploration, the starship Rugger-Guard is attacked by a ship of the Galbeston Empire. Dairugger, the super robot, is deployed in order to defend the Earth. It is somewhat by fate that they must help the people of Galbeston find a new planet before it explodes, and liberate it from its despotic Emperor. In the Japanese version, it does not have anything to do with King of the Beasts GoLion, as opposed to the U.S. version, Voltron: Defender of the Universe.\n\nThere are three assault team units: Land, Air, and Sea. There are a total of 15 parts referred to as \u0022Rugger,\u0022 which can combine together to form the super-robot Dairugger. The design of the 15 separate Rugger units came from the sport of rugby, since 15 players are required to form a rugby union.

As a response, regional governments established the Library Defense Force (LDF), whose members take up arms and put their lives on the line to protect freedom of expression. At the top of the Kanto branch of the LDF stands the Library Task Force (LTF): an elite squad consisting of only the most exceptional fighters.\n\nAs a high schooler, Iku Kasahara experienced the terror of censorship first-hand when she refused to surrender the newest volume of her favorite series to MBC agents. She only came out unscathed thanks to a lone member of the LDF, who protected her and her beloved book. Now in her 20s and still unable to forget the man who saved her, Kasahara joins the LDF in the hope of becoming just like her prince.\n\nBut LDF training turns out to be far more rigorous than she could have imagined, and her instructor, LTF member Atsushi Doujou, seems fixated on making her life a living hell. Given her struggles, Kasahara is shocked when she is selected as one of the two new LTF recruits as a result of Doujou\u0027s recommendation. As Kasahara does all she can to become worthy of the LTF and unravel her enigmatic superior\u0027s motivations, she wages war\u2014both on the battlefield and in her personal life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.43,"Rank":2036,"Popularity":2435,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2008,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:45"},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1380,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":3341,"Completed":33211,"OnHold":2410,"Dropped":2809,"PlanToWatch":32015,"Total":73786},"Favorites":406,"Producers":["Dentsu","Fuji TV","Code","Asmik Ace","ASCII Media Works","Sony Music Entertainment","Atelier Musa"],"Licensors":["Discotek Media"],"Studios":["Production I.G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Atashi no Machi, Asu no Machi (\u3042\u305F\u3057\u306E\u8857\u3001\u660E\u65E5\u306E\u8857)\u0022 by Hitomi Takahashi"],"Endings":["\u0022changes\u0022 by Base Ball Bear"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=5558","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T17:11:35.464+01:00"},{"Id":3614,"Title":"Yakushiji Ryouko no Kaiki Jikenbo","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75426.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":7,"Day":6,"Full":"2008-07-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":9,"Day":28,"Full":"2008-09-28"},"Synopsis":"Based on a series of light novels written by Tanaka Yoshiki and illustrated by Kakinouchi Narumi.\n\nThe story revolves around Ryouko Yakushiji, a 27-year-old multilingual investigator that graduated from Tokyo University\u0027s elite Department of Law, and the bizarre cases she faces while working for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

Ryo works for NASA as an engineer on a large rocket project. Anise, fellow Borgman and lover, has been reduced to flipping burgers in a restaurant.

Ryo, however, is as indecisive as ever and so she leaves for Japan without him.\n  \nChuck Sweager, the third Borgman, is a police officer, as is his girlfriend Miki. When she witnesses a fight amongst several cyborgs she tells Chuck, who says flatly that it cannot be possible, since the only living cyborgs are Ryo, Anise, and himself. But she convinces him and they investigate. Anise arrives for her new job, and when they meet for dinner they explain the situation to her. Anise volunteers to sneak around the Heaven\u0027s Gate project, which they believe to be the source of these new cyborgs. Ryo, meanwhile, is en route to Japan to go after his girlfriend. Accompanying him is Hussan, one of the two surviving researchers on the Borgman Project, who has been asked to appear before the Tokyo Police to help investigate.

No direct historical connections are identified between the two series, but it can be assumed that the original International Rescue evolved into its 2086 incarnation over those thirty years. The Tracy family are not mentioned in the animated series. In the animated series, the actual team is known as the Thunderbirds, whilst in the original series the name merely referred to their vehicles. The animated series is otherwise very similar to the original, with most episodes revolving around a natural or man-made disaster which the Thunderbirds team must investigate and help resolve. Unlike the original series, Thunderbirds 2086 also has an on-going story arc revolving around a breakaway independence group known as the Shadow Axis, led by the mysterious Star Crusher.

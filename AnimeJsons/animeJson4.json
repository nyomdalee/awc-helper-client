This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same.

His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he\u0027s delighted when his female pen pal says she\u0027ll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track.

However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\n\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \u0022the Metal.\u0022\n\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\n\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual\u0027s consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.\n\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.\n\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)","Mean":7.09,"Rank":3709,"Popularity":4094,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2008,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"00:59"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1354,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":1883,"Completed":5950,"OnHold":1583,"Dropped":2189,"PlanToWatch":15056,"Total":26661},"Favorites":51,"Producers":["VAP","Nippon Television Network","D.N.

She only came out unscathed thanks to a lone member of the LDF, who protected her and her beloved book. Now in her 20s and still unable to forget the man who saved her, Kasahara joins the LDF in the hope of becoming just like her prince.\n\nBut LDF training turns out to be far more rigorous than she could have imagined, and her instructor, LTF member Atsushi Doujou, seems fixated on making her life a living hell. Given her struggles, Kasahara is shocked when she is selected as one of the two new LTF recruits as a result of Doujou\u0027s recommendation.

A boy who is the descendant of the leader of the theives who met a grisly fate in the 1001 Nights bands together with 38 cats and a mouse to get back his rightful treasure from Ali Baba XXXIII, the descendent of Ali Baba who now rules the kingdom with an iron fist. This is a reversal of the good guy/bad guy roles in the original story! (perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved) This film is one of the most rollicking and action-packed films made by Toei, and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori, Akira Daikubara, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama. The original story about Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves itself is recounted at one point in the film in an unexpected and interesting way using shadow-puppets. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net) ","Mean":5.48,"Rank":11334,"Popularity":11201,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1971,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":3300,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":61,"Completed":995,"OnHold":38,"Dropped":100,"PlanToWatch":537,"Total":1731},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Kumo ga Oshiete Kureru Michi (\u96F2\u304C\u304A\u3057\u3048\u3066\u304F\u308C\u308B\u9053)\u0022 by Vocal Shop, Nobuyo Ooyama"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=2215","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.6616852Z"},{"Id":3844,"Title":"Apache Yakyuugun","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78281.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1971,"Month":10,"Day":6,"Full":"1971-10-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":1972,"Month":3,"Day":29,"Full":"1972-03-29"},"Synopsis":"A former baseball star who suffered a career crippling injury takes over as coach of a team of misfits in a poor village high school.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":6.25,"Rank":7980,"Popularity":12627,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":1971,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"19:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":71,"Completed":310,"OnHold":34,"Dropped":141,"PlanToWatch":500,"Total":1056},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Apache Yakyuugun (\u30A2\u30D1\u30C3\u30C1\u91CE\u7403\u8ECD)\u0022 by Eiko Hayashi (\u6797\u6075\u3005\u5B50)"],"Endings":["\u0022Minna Minna (\u307F\u3093\u306A \u307F\u3093\u306A)\u0022 by Shinpei Sakamoto"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=1902","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.6617086Z"},{"Id":3845,"Title":"Mahoutsukai Chappy","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/17490.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1972,"Month":4,"Day":3,"Full":"1972-04-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":1972,"Month":12,"Day":25,"Full":"1972-12-25"},"Synopsis":"Chappy\u0027s story is much like Mahou Tsukai Sally (Little Witch Sally).

No direct historical connections are identified between the two series, but it can be assumed that the original International Rescue evolved into its 2086 incarnation over those thirty years. The Tracy family are not mentioned in the animated series. In the animated series, the actual team is known as the Thunderbirds, whilst in the original series the name merely referred to their vehicles. The animated series is otherwise very similar to the original, with most episodes revolving around a natural or man-made disaster which the Thunderbirds team must investigate and help resolve. Unlike the original series, Thunderbirds 2086 also has an on-going story arc revolving around a breakaway independence group known as the Shadow Axis, led by the mysterious Star Crusher.

Like the previous movie, the stories deal with seeing the world through the eyes of people who are different from social norms.  The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature in 2008 from the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n\n1. \u0022The Third Wish\u201D (AN Dong-hui, RYU Jeong-wu). A fairy godmother appears before a visually impaired young woman to grant her three wishes. But this is no fairytale. The irritable middle-aged fairy wants to finish her job as soon as possible. Yet she proves to be helpful as she leads the woman through a busy marketplace, which is delightfully reminiscent of \u0022Amelie\u0022. But it\u0027s no walk in the park, as busy urbanites show no consideration for our protagonist. Yet she prevails through obstacles. With a walking stick, she taps together the heels of her shiny new shoes and follows the \u0022yellow brick road\u0022 (guiding tiles for the visually impaired) around the city.\n\n2. \u0022Ajukari\u201D (HONG Deok-pyo) is a street-style cartoon. It comically depicts how a certain macho \u0022complex\u0022 can cripple men. Male circumcision becomes the ultimate standard for being \u0022manly\u0022 and those who have failed to do the deed are forever fearful of going to public baths.\n\n3. \u0022Baby\u0022 (LEE Hong-su, LEE Hong-min) portrays the difficulties a career woman faces in having a child. \u0022I\u0027m not saying you can\u0027t have maternity leave, but can you afford to raise a child while working?\u0022 asks her boss. This smart story portrays everything from mother and daughter-in-law relationships to a parody of \u0022Tazza: The High Rollers\u0022 and hilarious episodes where an \u0022ambulance bus\u0022 picks up several patients en route.\n\n4. \u0022Shine Shine Shining\u0022 (KWON Mi-jeong) is drawn like a warm, watercolor storybook for children. Grade schooler Eun-jin is smart and popular, but she has a secret. She hides her curly hair, which she gets from her Filipino mother, in braids.\n\n5. \u0022Merry Golasmas\u0022 is an adorable claymation, or stop motion animation of models constructed from clay, plasticine, etc. It explores physical discrimination or stereotypes. In an open audition to find a Santa Claus, the real Santas \u2015 one who\u0027s black, another who\u0027s Asian, a female Santa and one in a wheelchair \u2015 lose to a fake Santa, a pot-bellied, Caucasian.\n\n6. \u201CLies\u0022 explores homosexuality.

While the latter boasts an immaculate reputation and favors students from wealthy backgrounds, the former is a nest for dim-witted delinquents. Everyone at Kikyo harbors a deep hatred for their Chidori neighbors.\n\nSixteen-year-old Rintarou Tsumugi is a student at Chidori whose intimidating face leads people to avoid him. Rintarou pays no mind to this, as he is content with his group of friends. However, there is something he has not told them yet: sometimes, he helps out at his family\u0027s cake shop.\n\nOne day at work, Rintarou sees a customer at a table, but she runs off before he can talk to her. The next day, he receives an apology from the girl, Kaoruko Waguri, who explains that she did not run away because of his appearance and that she believes Rintarou is a kind-hearted person. Although he is not used to Kaoruko\u0027s bright personality, Rintarou looks forward to forming a friendship with her.

They drive around in a light truck and collect broken TVs, computers, and other items while playing silly announcements over the speaker.\n\nTheir office is in a corner of a multi-tenant building and calls itself a recycle shop, but most of it looks like a warehouse with junk lined up with price tags. Before long, the four of them start receiving requests for junk that they can\u0027t handle on their own and by chance the abandoned items end up in GUMI\u0027s hands.\n\nMeanwhile, in the city center, an environmental beautification organization is formed and a cleanup operation for the downtown area is about to begin, under the pretext of redeveloping the area into a beautiful town. GUMI and the others rebel against the way of life in the downtown area that is gradually being threatened. As the government and beautification organizations each have their own agenda, breaking news breaks that a dangerous creature has been found on the garbage dump and a drastic move is made to clean up the dump, along with the downtown area, turning it into a vacant lot.\n\n(Source: Kenshi Yonezu YouTube Channel; translated)","Mean":7.11,"Rank":null,"Popularity":18816,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":228,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":9,"Completed":275,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":6,"PlanToWatch":51,"Total":343},"Favorites":4,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Production I.G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T19:09:15.992+01:00"},{"Id":59997,"Title":"Inferno Love Letter","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/145829.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":4,"Day":30,"Full":"2024-04-30"},"EndDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":4,"Day":30,"Full":"2024-04-30"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Inferno Love Letter by tuki.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":25154,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":170,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":4,"Completed":65,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":4,"PlanToWatch":11,"Total":87},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T19:09:18.411+01:00"},{"Id":59998,"Title":"Shu Shan Qi Xian Lu 2nd season","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/145831.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":9,"Day":30,"Full":"2024-09-30"},"EndDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":11,"Day":25,"Full":"2024-11-25"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":14118,"Popularity":21750,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":952,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":32,"Completed":23,"OnHold":7,"Dropped":33,"PlanToWatch":80,"Total":175},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T19:09:20.874+01:00"}]

A young boy, Shigeru, left home for his job as a building excavator that morning, carrying a bento made by his mother, only to never return home again. Before long, his mother managed to find Shigeru\u0027s remains, and she noticed the completely black and carbonized bento box next to them. \n\nThis is an anime adaptation of the original book, \u0022Makkuro na Obentou (The Charred Lunchbox)\u0022 written by Kodama Tatsuharu and illustrated by Kitajima Shinpei. The bento box that becomes the focus of the story is actually on display in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":null,"Rank":17217,"Popularity":16585,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1990,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Book","AverageEpisodeDuration":3000,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":26,"Completed":111,"OnHold":17,"Dropped":67,"PlanToWatch":308,"Total":529},"Favorites":1,"Producers":["Kyodo Eiga"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Okashi na Keisan (\u304A\u304B\u3057\u306A\u8A08\u7B97)\u0022 by Marie\u0027s Band (\u559C\u5C4B\u6B66\u30DE\u30EA\u30FC)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=5225","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T03:20:01.436+01:00"},{"Id":20231,"Title":"Manga Kodomo Bunko","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/53841.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1978,"Month":10,"Day":6,"Full":"1978-10-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":1979,"Month":9,"Day":28,"Full":"1979-09-28"},"Synopsis":"A collection of children\u0027s stories and tales from traditional Japanese folklore.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":null,"Rank":17278,"Popularity":16341,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":51,"StartSeason":{"Year":1978,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Unknown","StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":31,"Completed":193,"OnHold":31,"Dropped":103,"PlanToWatch":202,"Total":560},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Group TAC"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Yondeiru\u0022 by Mitsuko Horie"],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6334","LastUpdated":"2025-01-06T00:03:55.701+01:00"},{"Id":20233,"Title":"Tonari no Tamageta-kun","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/53845.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1974,"Month":4,"Day":5,"Full":"1974-04-05"},"EndDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":6,"Day":27,"Full":"1975-06-27"},"Synopsis":"The adventures of a witless boy who finds a time machine hidden in a cave near his house.

The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \u0022Friar Tuck,\u0022 they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.\n\nTheir bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.\n\nThe girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\u2014Alwine\u0027s accomplice\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster\u0027s wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron\u0027s troops, led by Gilbert\u2014a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle\u0027s dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success.

There\u0027s a little disclaimer at the front that says \u0022This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\u0022 and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. \n\nThe \u0022travel writer\u0022 turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn\u0027t really care about trains; she\u0027s cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he\u0027s completely gung-ho as long as he\u0027s following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. \n\nThroughout, though, it feels real \u2014if you\u0027ve travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel\u2014 and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga! \n\nIn addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There\u0027s always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there\u0027s really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ","Mean":6.24,"Rank":8027,"Popularity":10069,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1470,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":219,"Completed":597,"OnHold":189,"Dropped":278,"PlanToWatch":1423,"Total":2706},"Favorites":7,"Producers":["Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","Toei Video","Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","Shogakukan"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Group TAC"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Nanka Ari Kamo Ne (\u306A\u3093\u304B\u30A2\u30EA\u304B\u3082\u306D)\u0022 by SUPER BELL\u0022Z"],"Endings":["\u0022Ooi Naru Tabiji (\u5927\u3044\u306A\u308B\u65C5\u8DEF)\u0022 by SUPER BELL\u0022Z"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=5197","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T16:50:12.534+01:00"},{"Id":2553,"Title":"Flanders no Inu","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/17492.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":1,"Day":5,"Full":"1975-01-05"},"EndDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":12,"Day":28,"Full":"1975-12-28"},"Synopsis":"Nello Tarth is a poor but happy orphan who lives with his grandfather Jehan in a little village nearby Antwerp.

One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet\u2019s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality.

Of course, there\u0027s also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \u0022BlackBird\u0022). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car\u0027s previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner\u0027s death. The manga follows Akio\u0027s various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ","Mean":7.48,"Rank":1860,"Popularity":3302,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":3,"Name":"Racing"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":4811,"Completed":18694,"OnHold":2545,"Dropped":2607,"PlanToWatch":14126,"Total":42783},"Favorites":568,"Producers":["OB Planning"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["A.C.G.T."],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022lights and any more\u0022 by TRF"],"Endings":["\u0022Talking bout good days\u0022 by Mother Ninja"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=5088","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T16:51:36.657+01:00"},{"Id":2609,"Title":"Kakyuusei (TV)","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/84837.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1999,"Month":7,"Day":2,"Full":"1999-07-02"},"EndDate":{"Year":1999,"Month":9,"Day":24,"Full":"1999-09-24"},"Synopsis":"When Tsuyoshi rushed to school as usual, he found a girl who tried to help a kitten which couldn\u0027t get down from a tree.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world\u0027s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (\u0027Bishounen-Killer\u0027) Bancoran. Bancoran\u0027s nickname doesn\u0027t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran\u0027s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour\u0027s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran\u0027s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang\u0027s Metropolis, while Jack\u0027s \u0027apartment\u0027 bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst\u0027s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.\n\n(Source: aestheticism.com)","Mean":7.25,"Rank":2885,"Popularity":6781,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":28,"Name":"Boys Love"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":49,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Thrusday","StartTime":"19:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1475,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":934,"Completed":1251,"OnHold":781,"Dropped":583,"PlanToWatch":4714,"Total":8263},"Favorites":109,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Patalliro!\u0022 by Fusako Fujimoto"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Utsukushisa wa Tsumi\u0022 by Eri Takeda (eps 1-20,48-49)","2: \u0022Cock Robin Ondo\u0022 by Fuyumi Shiraishi \u0026 Slapstick (eps 21-47)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=2990","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T16:57:07.755+01:00"},{"Id":2836,"Title":"Chiisana Viking Vickie","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/3940.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1974,"Month":4,"Day":3,"Full":"1974-04-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":9,"Day":24,"Full":"1975-09-24"},"Synopsis":"Long ago, in a little Viking Village called Flake, young Wickie lives a happy life.

Near the epicenter of the activity, the expedition discovers vast land markings akin to the Nazca paleoglyphs drawn in the Peruvian desert. Stranger still is the presence of an enormous underground cavern below these symbols. At the bottom of the chasm, a portion of a tremendous tower juts from the ground. Armed with ultra-digital cameras, the scientific team transmits their findings to the Command Center. One explorer traces the image of a star chart engraved on the tower\u0027s exterior. The tower begins to emit a sinister howling as if possessed by demonic forces. One by one, the members of the expedition writhe in pain and die. Those observing the scene at the Command Center watch helplessly. As the high-frequency noise suffuses their headquarters, they too succumb and die in agony. When the waves of the frequency are analyzed, they are discovered to be a beacon directed at the planet Elysium, which lies beyond Earth\u0027s solar system.\n\nVan, the reluctant hero of the story, is an 18-year-old pizza delivery boy in Manhattan. He competes in the most popular sport of the 22nd century -- turbo jai alai racing. These races are fast paced and deadly affairs that integrate virtual reality into the competition. He\u0027s deeply in love with Lydia, a talented ballerina. In the chaotic futuristic metropolis, they only have each other and their dreams. Van and Lydia desperately want the chance to escape the polluted city-scape. Despite the dangers, Van enters a turbo jai alai race in the hopes of winning first prize -- two tickets to a galactic resort where Lydia can audition for the Jupiter Ballet.\n\nMeanwhile, earth\u0027s deep space observation vessel, the Odyssey, patrols the planet\u0027s orbital perimeter. The Odyssey is confronted by an armada of sophisticated alien spacecraft from Elysium. The awed human crew prepares to receive the Elysian ambassador, Yaspe. Without warning, the Odyssey loses control of its weapons, fires on the ambassador\u0027s vessel and destroys it. This tragic misunderstanding results in brutal retaliation by the Elysian fleet, culminating in the destruction of the Odyssey and a full-scale attack on Earth.\n\nVan\u0027s deadly sport of choice turns deadlier when the stadium he is competing in comes under fire from the Elysian barrage. Van struggles through the chaos on his turbo-cycle to rescue Lydia from the collapsing stands. The indiscriminate Elysian onslaught scorches cities worldwide. Van and Lydia flee through the burning streets of Manhattan seeking safety. After a series of harrowing escapes, they find refuge in a claustrophobic fall-out shelter. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":5.21,"Rank":12006,"Popularity":11807,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2003,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":5165,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":46,"Completed":1002,"OnHold":21,"Dropped":89,"PlanToWatch":365,"Total":1523},"Favorites":1,"Producers":["Hanho Heung-Up","Big Film Entertainment"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Toei Animation","OLM Digital"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=1340","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T16:59:00.982+01:00"},{"Id":2942,"Title":"Sketchbook: Full Color\u0027s","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/137274.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":10,"Day":2,"Full":"2007-10-02"},"EndDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":12,"Day":25,"Full":"2007-12-25"},"Synopsis":"To Sora Kajiwara, the world is full of wonderful and adorable things she wants to draw\u2014cats being a popular object of her affection.

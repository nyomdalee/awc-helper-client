Though the effort was a success, the Zol invasion could not seize Fire Horse Village, where an outbreak of a mysterious deadly disease known as Black Wolf Fever occurred. Since then, the people have believed the illness has been eradicated.\n\nAt a salt mine overseen by Zol authorities, Van Gansa is a prisoner of war carrying out a forced labor sentence. One night, a pack of spirit-like wolves attack the mine; while Van and a young girl named Yuna are bitten, the two escape as the only survivors. In the official investigation following the incident, the findings indicate that the wolves were carriers of Black Wolf Fever, which led to the swift deaths of the guards and workers.\n\nEager to experience freedom again, Van wastes no time settling down with Yuna in a small farming village. However, Van does not know that he is being followed. Pursued both by those who wish to harvest his blood to cure Black Wolf Fever and those who want to stop those efforts at all costs, Van faces a greater issue plaguing the nation that may spread to countries beyond.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.88,"Rank":4893,"Popularity":4219,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":6801,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":855,"Completed":7736,"OnHold":334,"Dropped":246,"PlanToWatch":21127,"Total":30298},"Favorites":45,"Producers":["Yomiuri Telecasting","TOHO","Nippon Television Network","JR East Marketing \u0026 Communications","Kadokawa","Movie Walker"],"Licensors":["GKIDS"],"Studios":["Production I.G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022One Reason\u0022 by milet"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14167","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:53:34.998+01:00"},{"Id":38016,"Title":"Zannen na Ikimono Jiten","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1201/93208.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":8,"Day":6,"Full":"2018-08-06"},"EndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":8,"Day":17,"Full":"2018-08-17"},"Synopsis":"The book series offers humourous introductions to surprising aspects of living creatures, such as \u0022raccoons don\u0027t really wash their food,\u0022 and \u0022dolphins would drown if they fall completely asleep.\u0022 \n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":5.98,"Rank":9955,"Popularity":16035,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":56,"Name":"Educational"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Not scheduled once per week","StartTime":"09:50"},"Source":"Picture Book","AverageEpisodeDuration":300,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":27,"Completed":203,"OnHold":14,"Dropped":121,"PlanToWatch":230,"Total":595},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["NHK","Fanworks"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["NHK Enterprises"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14166","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:53:37.787+01:00"},{"Id":38017,"Title":"Yuukai Anna","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1028/112649.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":7,"Day":21,"Full":"2018-07-21"},"EndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":7,"Day":21,"Full":"2018-07-21"},"Synopsis":"196X.

However, he does not get to play the role of the protagonist, but instead he becomes the scumbag master destined to suffer a humiliating defeat.\n\nShen Yuan, now known as cultivation master Shen Qingqiu, makes it his mission to change his fate so that he does not fall to his disciple, Luo Binghe, the protagonist of the novel.

However, there are many aspects of our existence that science has not yet found a solution to and cannot decipher with numbers. The most notorious of these is the concept of love. While it may seem impossible to apply scientific theory to such an intricate and complex emotion, a daring pair of quick-witted Saitama University scientists aim to take on the challenge.\n\nOne day the bold and beautiful Ayame Himuro outwardly declares that she is in love with Shinya Yukimura, her fellow logical and level-headed scientist. Acknowledging his own lack of experience with romance, Yukimura questions what factors constitute love in the first place and whether he is in love with Himuro or not. Both clueless in the dealings of love, the pair begin to conduct detailed experiments on one another to test the human characteristics that indicate love and discern whether they demonstrate these traits toward each other.\n\nAs Himuro and Yukimura begin their intimate analysis, can the two scientists successfully apply scientific theory, with the help of their friends, to quantify the feelings they express for one another?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.35,"Rank":2559,"Popularity":674,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":34249,"Completed":185630,"OnHold":14948,"Dropped":19827,"PlanToWatch":114333,"Total":368987},"Favorites":1160,"Producers":["Flex Comix","Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting","BS11","Yomiuri TV Enterprise","Kanetsu Investment","Toyo Recording","ibis Capital Partners","Y\u0026N Brothers","SUPA LOVE"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Zero-G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022PARADOX\u0022 by Sora Amamiya"],"Endings":["\u0022Turing Love feat.Sou (\u30C1\u30E5\u30FC\u30EA\u30F3\u30B0\u30E9\u30D6 feat.Sou)\u0022 by Akari Nanawo"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14590","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T08:19:20.33+01:00"},{"Id":38993,"Title":"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":7,"Day":7,"Full":"2019-07-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":9,"Day":22,"Full":"2019-09-22"},"Synopsis":"Even after spending a considerable amount of time with Takagi, Nishikata is still struggling to find a perfect plan to defeat the expert teaser.

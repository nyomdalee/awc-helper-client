Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole\u0027s residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.05,"Rank":529,"Popularity":405,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":14,"Name":"Horror"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":58,"Name":"Gore"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1422,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":33195,"Completed":312197,"OnHold":13614,"Dropped":14255,"PlanToWatch":144671,"Total":517932},"Favorites":8277,"Producers":["Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","Mainichi Broadcasting System","Movic","TOHO animation","BS11","Shogakukan","Sumitomo","RAY","Pia"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["MAPPA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Welcome to Chaos (Welcome \u30C8\u30A5 \u6DF7\u6C8C\uFF08\u30AB\u30AA\u30B9\uFF09)\u0022 by (K) NoW_NAME"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Who am I ?\u0022 by (K) NoW_NAME (eps 1-2, 7)","2: \u0022Night SURFING\u0022 by (K) NoW_NAME (eps 3-4)","3: \u0022D.D.D.D.\u0022 by (K) NoW_NAME (eps 5-6)","4: \u0022Strange Meat Pie\u0022 by (K) NoW_NAME (eps 8-9)","5: \u0022SECONDs FLY\u0022 by (K) NoW_NAME (eps 10-11)","6: \u0022404\u0022 by (K) NoW_NAME (eps 12)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14483","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.0809782Z"},{"Id":38669,"Title":"Tsukiuta.

Naming her in-game character Maple, she sets out on her journey. As a complete novice to such games, she allocates all of her stat points into vitality, desiring to not get hurt. With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can\u0027t move quickly or hit hard.\n\nThis does not end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills such as Total Defense, Poison Immunity, and Devour. These skills, along with the incredibly powerful items she obtains, allow her to obliterate most enemies in a single hit. After only a few days of playing the game, Maple claims third place in a server-wide event, gaining a reputation as a player who is both unkillable and absurdly powerful.\n\nDespite her overpowered character, Kaede has much to learn. As she progresses through the game, she meets new friends and acquaintances, helping her complete new levels and events. Through all of her adventures, she may even pick up some other crazy skills that exceed all expectations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.54,"Rank":1621,"Popularity":412,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":79,"Name":"Video Game"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":38338,"Completed":358903,"OnHold":11842,"Dropped":19961,"PlanToWatch":79708,"Total":508752},"Favorites":3642,"Producers":["AT-X","MAGES.","Docomo Anime Store","Sammy","ABC Animation","Kadokawa Media House","Kadokawa","D-techno"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["SILVER LINK."],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Kyuukyoku Unbalance!

Unfortunately, the population boom also brought its fair share of problems\u2014drugs, prostitution, and trafficking. To combat the rampant crime lurking in the city\u0027s shadows, a new department was established in the San-Teresa Metropolitan Police.\n\nFormer JSDF soldier Kei Matoba is one of the best cops that the department has to offer, despite his inclination to occasionally bend the rules. After a fairy trafficking case goes wrong, Kei loses Rick Fury, his friend and partner of four years, setting him on a quest for vengeance. To help him with the case, the department pairs him with Tilarna Exedilika, a noble of the Farbani Kingdom. As one of the Knights of Mirvor, her duty is to rescue the noble fairy that Kei encountered during his last case. Despite his distaste for non-humans, he accepts the arrangement at the request of his superiors.

So when he unexpectedly transmigrates into the world of Proud Immortal Demon Way, he knows exactly how the story is going to proceed. However, he does not get to play the role of the protagonist, but instead he becomes the scumbag master destined to suffer a humiliating defeat.\n\nShen Yuan, now known as cultivation master Shen Qingqiu, makes it his mission to change his fate so that he does not fall to his disciple, Luo Binghe, the protagonist of the novel. Trying to break away from the cruel personality of the original Shen Qingqiu seems impossible as any uncharacteristic behavior is blocked by a monitoring system meant to keep him from derailing the plot.\n\nShen Yuan must find a way to befriend Luo Binghe so that he has no reason to seek revenge on his teacher in the future. But with the set series of tragedies meant to befall the protagonist at the hands of Shen Qingqiu, this teacher has his work cut out for him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.74,"Rank":1072,"Popularity":4867,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":62,"Name":"Isekai"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Web Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1194,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":1586,"Completed":11522,"OnHold":296,"Dropped":354,"PlanToWatch":4237,"Total":17995},"Favorites":481,"Producers":["Tencent Penguin Pictures","iQIYI"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Djinn Power"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Wang Yan Ge (\u5FD8\u8A00\u6B4C)\u0022 by R1SE-Zhao Lei (R1SE-\u8D75\u78CA)"],"Endings":["\u0022Que Chun Shan (\u5374\u6625\u5C71)\u0022 by Angelina Zhu (\u6731\u6893\u6EB6)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=15644","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.0896446Z"},{"Id":38992,"Title":"Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita.","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/103533.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":1,"Day":11,"Full":"2020-01-11"},"EndDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":3,"Day":28,"Full":"2020-03-28"},"Synopsis":"It is widely believed that science can provide rational explanations for the countless phenomena of our universe. However, there are many aspects of our existence that science has not yet found a solution to and cannot decipher with numbers. The most notorious of these is the concept of love. While it may seem impossible to apply scientific theory to such an intricate and complex emotion, a daring pair of quick-witted Saitama University scientists aim to take on the challenge.\n\nOne day the bold and beautiful Ayame Himuro outwardly declares that she is in love with Shinya Yukimura, her fellow logical and level-headed scientist. Acknowledging his own lack of experience with romance, Yukimura questions what factors constitute love in the first place and whether he is in love with Himuro or not. Both clueless in the dealings of love, the pair begin to conduct detailed experiments on one another to test the human characteristics that indicate love and discern whether they demonstrate these traits toward each other.\n\nAs Himuro and Yukimura begin their intimate analysis, can the two scientists successfully apply scientific theory, with the help of their friends, to quantify the feelings they express for one another?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.36,"Rank":2331,"Popularity":667,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":32259,"Completed":166542,"OnHold":13638,"Dropped":17684,"PlanToWatch":104133,"Total":334256},"Favorites":1129,"Producers":["Flex Comix","Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting","BS11","Yomiuri TV Enterprise","Kanetsu Investment","Toyo Recording","ibis Capital Partners","Y\u0026N Brothers","SUPA LOVE"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Zero-G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022PARADOX\u0022 by Sora Amamiya"],"Endings":["\u0022Turing Love feat.Sou (\u30C1\u30E5\u30FC\u30EA\u30F3\u30B0\u30E9\u30D6 feat.Sou)\u0022 by Akari Nanawo"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14590","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.0896698Z"},{"Id":38993,"Title":"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":7,"Day":7,"Full":"2019-07-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":9,"Day":22,"Full":"2019-09-22"},"Synopsis":"Even after spending a considerable amount of time with Takagi, Nishikata is still struggling to find a perfect plan to defeat the expert teaser.

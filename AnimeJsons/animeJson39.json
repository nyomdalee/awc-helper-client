With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can\u0027t move quickly or hit hard.\n\nThis does not end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills such as Total Defense, Poison Immunity, and Devour.

Club members Chika Kudou, Satowa Houzuki, Takezou Kurata, Hiro Kurusu, Kouta Mizuhara, Saneyasu Adachi, and Michitaka Sakai are devastated to learn the negative results of their performance, leaving them crushed. Nonetheless, the group recognizes their potential and enthusiastically agree to collectively sharpen their skills, improve their flaws, and develop higher caliber playing to succeed in the upcoming national qualifiers in winter.\n\nWith the help of their now willing club advisor Suzuka Takinami, the group\u0027s goal gradually becomes achievable as they begin to grasp the foundations of good music and refine their koto-playing abilities, with the suggestion of performing more often to gain what they lack most\u2014experience.\n\nHowever, as their journey to nationals is underway, the koto club members face challenges that obstruct their focus and progress. Not only does the threat of other powerhouse schools and musicians remain, but the high school issues of budding romance and soon-to-be-graduating seniors also begin to push the limits of the determined group of teenagers and the future of the koto club.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.42,"Rank":162,"Popularity":1337,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"},{"Id":70,"Name":"Performing Arts"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":8394,"Completed":117658,"OnHold":2959,"Dropped":1888,"PlanToWatch":41321,"Total":172220},"Favorites":1688,"Producers":["WOWOW","Movic","KlockWorx","Memory-Tech","King Records","Shueisha","Pony Canyon Enterprises"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Platinum Vision"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Harmony\u0022 by Shouta Aoi"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Rainbow\u0022 by Yuuma Uchida (eps 1-12)","2: \u0022Tone\u0022 by Shouta Aoi (eps 13)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14553","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:17:52.688+01:00"},{"Id":38891,"Title":"Sora no Method: Mou Hitotsu no Negai","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1472/97902.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":10,"Day":11,"Full":"2019-10-11"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2019-10-11"},"Synopsis":"The official website of Sora no Method (Celestial Method) announced a new episode for the anime series.

Acknowledging his own lack of experience with romance, Yukimura questions what factors constitute love in the first place and whether he is in love with Himuro or not. Both clueless in the dealings of love, the pair begin to conduct detailed experiments on one another to test the human characteristics that indicate love and discern whether they demonstrate these traits toward each other.\n\nAs Himuro and Yukimura begin their intimate analysis, can the two scientists successfully apply scientific theory, with the help of their friends, to quantify the feelings they express for one another?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.35,"Rank":2380,"Popularity":674,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":32483,"Completed":170660,"OnHold":13929,"Dropped":18192,"PlanToWatch":106176,"Total":341440},"Favorites":1141,"Producers":["Flex Comix","Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting","BS11","Yomiuri TV Enterprise","Kanetsu Investment","Toyo Recording","ibis Capital Partners","Y\u0026N Brothers","SUPA LOVE"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Zero-G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022PARADOX\u0022 by Sora Amamiya"],"Endings":["\u0022Turing Love feat.Sou (\u30C1\u30E5\u30FC\u30EA\u30F3\u30B0\u30E9\u30D6 feat.Sou)\u0022 by Akari Nanawo"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14590","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:19:41.965+01:00"},{"Id":38993,"Title":"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":7,"Day":7,"Full":"2019-07-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":9,"Day":22,"Full":"2019-09-22"},"Synopsis":"Even after spending a considerable amount of time with Takagi, Nishikata is still struggling to find a perfect plan to defeat the expert teaser.

She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura\u0027s persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.\n\nAs the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day. Her apparent nonchalance and unpredictability disrupts the protagonist\u0027s impassive flow of life, gradually opening his heart as he discovers and embraces the true meaning of living.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.55,"Rank":115,"Popularity":163,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":6522,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":25401,"Completed":757276,"OnHold":5556,"Dropped":2404,"PlanToWatch":227554,"Total":1018191},"Favorites":21710,"Producers":["Aniplex","ABC Animation"],"Licensors":["Aniplex of America"],"Studios":["Studio VOLN"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Fanfare (\u30D5\u30A1\u30F3\u30D5\u30A1\u30FC\u30EC)\u0022 by sumika"],"Endings":["\u0022Shunkashuutou (\u6625\u590F\u79CB\u51AC)\u0022 by sumika"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13363","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:02:16.516+01:00"},{"Id":36099,"Title":"The Gift","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/87225.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"2016-04-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"2016-04-04"},"Synopsis":"All shots are created with game engine Unity.

This orphan is Shin, a normal salaryman in modern-day Japan who was reincarnated into Merlin\u0027s world while still retaining his past memories. As the years pass, Shin displays unparalleled talent in both magic casting and martial arts, much to Merlin\u0027s constant amazement.\n\nOn his 15th birthday, however, it becomes apparent that Shin only developed his combat skills and nothing else, leaving him with blatant social awkwardness, a lack of common sense, and a middling sense of responsibility. As a result, Shin enrolls in the kingdom\u0027s Magic Academy to hone his skills and mature among other teenagers. However, living a normal life is impossible, as he is established as a local celebrity almost as soon as he arrives.\n\nAs Shin Wolford adjusts to his high school life in the capital, he makes new friends, learns about the world, and fights off the various forces of evil surrounding him and his city.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.62,"Rank":6353,"Popularity":367,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":62,"Name":"Isekai"},{"Id":72,"Name":"Reincarnation"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"23:30"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":36705,"Completed":468017,"OnHold":8057,"Dropped":29776,"PlanToWatch":76756,"Total":619311},"Favorites":3011,"Producers":["Sotsu","Docomo Anime Store","ABC Animation","Kadokawa"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["SILVER LINK."],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Ultimate\u2606MAGIC (\u30A2\u30EB\u30C6\u30A3\u30E1\u30C3\u30C8\u2606MAGIC)\u0022 by i\u2606Ris"],"Endings":["\u0022Attouteki Vivid Days (\u5727\u5012\u7684 Vivid Days)\u0022 by Nanami Yoshi.

Aoi valiantly refuses and decides to settle things on her own terms: she will pay off the debt herself by opening an eatery at Oodanna\u0027s inn.\n\nKakuriyo no Yadomeshi follows the journey of Aoi as she proceeds to change and touch the lives of the ayakashi through the one weapon she has against them\u2014her delicious cooking.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.54,"Rank":1763,"Popularity":1389,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":47,"Name":"Gourmet"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":62,"Name":"Isekai"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"22:30"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":20730,"Completed":81628,"OnHold":8317,"Dropped":10375,"PlanToWatch":59438,"Total":180488},"Favorites":1482,"Producers":["DLE","flying DOG","Studio Mausu","BS Fuji","Tokyo MX","NADA Holdings","Kadokawa","Happinet"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Gonzo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Tomoshibi no Manimani (\u706F\u706B\u306E\u307E\u306B\u307E\u306B)\u0022 by Nao Touyama (eps 1-9, 11-14)","2: \u0022Utsushiyo no Yume (\u30A6\u30C4\u30B7\u30E8\u30CE\u30E6\u30E1)\u0022 by nano (eps 15-26)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Color (\u5F69 -color-)\u0022 by Manami Numakura (eps 1-2, 4, 6-7, 9-12)","2: \u0022Negaibana (\u9858\u3044\u82B1)\u0022 by Oodanna (Katsuyuki Konishi) (eps 3)","3: \u0022Toki no Suna (\u6642\u306E\u7802)\u0022 by Akatsuki (Yuuma Uchida) \u0026 Suzuran (Maaya Uchida) (eps 5)","4: \u0022My sweet sweet love\u0022 by Byakuya (Atsushi Tamaru) (eps 8)","5: \u0022Kaze (\u98A8)\u0022 by Ginji (Shunichi Toki) (eps 13)","6: \u0022Utsushiyo no Yume (\u30A6\u30C4\u30B7\u30E8\u30CE\u30E6\u30E1)\u0022 by nano  (eps 14)","7: \u0022Shiranai Kimochi (\u77E5\u3089\u306A\u3044\u6C17\u6301\u3061)\u0022 by Megumi Nakajima (eps 15-17, 19-20, 22, 24, 26)","8: \u0022Yashiho no Hana (\u30E4\u30B7\u30DB\u30CE\u30CF\u30CA)\u0022 by Hatori (Takuma Terashima) (eps 18)","9: \u0022Koi Mamori Uta (\u604B\u5B88\u5504)\u0022 by Hideyoshi (Tetsuya Kakihara) (eps 21)","10: \u0022Setsuna no Kirameki (\u5239\u90A3\u306E\u714C\u3081\u304D)\u0022 by Raijuu (Satoshi Hino) (eps 23)","11: \u0022Eien no Kizuna (\u6C38\u9060\u306E\u7D46)\u0022 by Ranmaru (Kaito Ishikawa) (eps 25)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13564","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:20:08.151+01:00"},{"Id":36755,"Title":"Juvenile Pornography The Animation","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1131/103773.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":12,"Day":1,"Full":"2017-12-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":12,"Day":1,"Full":"2017-12-01"},"Synopsis":"A boy stumbles upon a beautiful girl reading something in the park.\n\nWhat could she be reading?

Out of desperation she turns to the message board Free Friends to earn some money. She develops a relationship with her first partner, Kaito, without realizing that they\u0027re much more than strangers...\n\nKaito, the newest student teacher at Minatohashi Higashi Academy, has a vice. Unable and unwilling to form meaningful, intimate relationships with other people, he instead satiates his need for intimacy through compensated dating. In order to feed this habit, he uses a message board known as Free Friends. Through its services, he can make the necessary arrangements and appointments with the various girls who also use the site, mainly students running away from home or simply in need of extra income.\n\nHis troubles trace back to a deeply seated complex: a hollow, yearning feeling brought on by the thought and sight of violets. Violets, or \u0022Sumire\u0022, remind him of the sister he\u0027d been separated from during their childhood when their parents had divorced. Only by losing himself in a woman\u0027s body can he rid himself of those clinging, nostalgic feelings.\n\nRight before the school year begins, the mere reminder of the academy\u0027s famed violet flowerbeds (despite them not even being in bloom at the time) is enough to drive Kaito to Free Friends. A seemingly routine exchange leaves him completely unprepared for the girl waiting for him: an absolutely stunning beauty by the pseudonym of \u0022Sumi\u0022.\n\nA few days later, he discovers that \u0022Sumi\u0022 is not only a student at the exact same school he teaches at, but that her classmates call her \u0022Sumire\u0022. Incredulous, Kaito checks the school rosters. Surely it\u0027s not the same Sumire he knows; surely it\u0027s just another girl with the same given name? But as if setting him up for the universe\u0027s biggest punchline, the only Sumire at the school is none other than his very own Shinozaki Sumire, the sister his mother had taken away from him. Kaito\u0027s dreams of one day reuniting with his sister have in fact already been realized... just not in a way that he ever could have imagined.\n\n(Source: VNDB)","Mean":6.51,"Rank":null,"Popularity":8080,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[{"Id":12,"Name":"Hentai"}],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":4,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Visual Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"Rx","Statistics":{"Watching":997,"Completed":2624,"OnHold":433,"Dropped":337,"PlanToWatch":1904,"Total":6295},"Favorites":7,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["PoRO"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13621","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T07:23:46.822+01:00"},{"Id":36881,"Title":"Dennou Senshi Dokan-kun","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1091/105649.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":1,"Day":15,"Full":"2007-01-15"},"EndDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":3,"Day":26,"Full":"2007-03-26"},"Synopsis":"An animated series that aired within the variety program \u0022Fight Tension\u2606Depart.\u0022","Mean":null,"Rank":20027,"Popularity":19381,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":11,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Unknown","StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":360,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":18,"Completed":113,"OnHold":9,"Dropped":74,"PlanToWatch":94,"Total":308},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["TV Tokyo"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["DLE"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6641","LastUpdated":"2025-01-06T00:40:28.03+01:00"},{"Id":36882,"Title":"Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1776/97682.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":7,"Day":8,"Full":"2019-07-08"},"EndDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":10,"Day":7,"Full":"2019-10-07"},"Synopsis":"The ordinary life of 17-year-old otaku Hajime Nagumo is disrupted when he and his classmates are summoned to a fantasy world and tasked with saving mankind.

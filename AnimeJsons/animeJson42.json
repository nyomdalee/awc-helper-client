As if by fate, Ryou encounters Ichika again later that night; she happens to be the best friend of his little sister, Rio.\n\nWanting to \u0022thank\u0022 her, Ryou attempts to woo Ichika by employing his usual flirtatious tactics only to be immediately shot down, his target creeped out by his behavior. Rather than being discouraged, Ryou instead becomes more enthralled by her, and he begins to do everything he can to steal Ichika\u0027s heart despite receiving disgusted reactions each time. However, as time passes by, will Ichika remain repulsed by Ryou\u0027s creepy yet dedicated advances?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.14,"Rank":3443,"Popularity":1006,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":25449,"Completed":124863,"OnHold":5763,"Dropped":13872,"PlanToWatch":62772,"Total":232719},"Favorites":1676,"Producers":["BS Fuji","Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting","Amusement Media Academy","Ichijinsha","Kanetsu Investment","Sonilude","Toyo Recording","BloomZ","AMG Entertainment","MediaNet Pictures","Christmas Holly","Miyazaki Broadcasting","C-one"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Nomad"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Monoqlo City (\u30E2\u30CE\u30AF\u30ED\u30B7\u30C6\u30A3)\u0022 by ACE COLLECTION"],"Endings":["\u0022Rinaria (\u30EA\u30CA\u30EA\u30A2)\u0022 by Maruritoryuuga (\u307E\u308B\u308A\u3068\u308A\u3085\u3046\u304C)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=15362","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:51:25.19+01:00"},{"Id":41105,"Title":"Chihayafuru 3: Ima Hitotabi no","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1014/105666.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":1,"Day":29,"Full":"2020-01-29"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2020-01-29"},"Synopsis":"Recap of first fifteen episodes of Chihayafuru 3.","Mean":6.8,"Rank":5038,"Popularity":6383,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":11,"Name":"Strategy Game"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":43,"Name":"Josei"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1340,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":271,"Completed":5245,"OnHold":125,"Dropped":200,"PlanToWatch":3732,"Total":9573},"Favorites":9,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Madhouse"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022COLORFUL\u0022 by 99RadioService"],"Endings":["\u0022Hitomebore (\u4E00\u76EE\u60DA\u308C)\u0022 by Band Harassment (\u30D0\u30F3\u30C9\u30CF\u30E9\u30B9\u30E1\u30F3\u30C8)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13841","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:51:27.17+01:00"},{"Id":41109,"Title":"Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1510/108026.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":1,"Day":13,"Full":"2021-01-13"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":3,"Day":31,"Full":"2021-03-31"},"Synopsis":"Third season of Log Horizon.\n\nIt\u0027s been a year since Shiroe and his friends were trapped in Akiba due to the Catastrophe.

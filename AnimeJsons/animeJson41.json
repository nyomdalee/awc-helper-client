However, after swindling a seemingly clueless tourist, Makoto discovers that he was the one tricked and, to make matters worse, that the police are now after him. \n\nWhile making his escape, he runs into the tourist once again, who turns out to be a fellow con man named Laurent Thierry, and ends up following him to Los Angeles. In an attempt to defend his self-proclaimed title of \u0022Japan\u0027s Greatest Swindler,\u0022 Makoto challenges his rival to determine the better scammer. Accepting the competition, Laurent drops them off outside a huge mansion and claims that their target will be the biggest mafia boss on the West Coast.\n\nAs Makoto becomes increasingly involved with the cunning Laurent, his colorful associates, and the world of international high-stakes fraud, he soon realizes that he got more than what he bargained for as his self-declared skills are continually put to the test.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.22,"Rank":328,"Popularity":313,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":23,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Thrusday","StartTime":"00:55"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1380,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":65707,"Completed":341156,"OnHold":33286,"Dropped":22719,"PlanToWatch":181293,"Total":644161},"Favorites":9802,"Producers":["Production I.G","Fuji TV","BS Fuji","TOHO animation","Hakuhodo DY Media Partners"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Wit Studio"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022G.P.\u0022 by Yutaka Yamada"],"Endings":["\u0022The Great Pretender\u0022 by Freddie Mercury"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14990","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:36:38.606+01:00"},{"Id":40056,"Title":"Deca-Dence","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1787/132772.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":7,"Day":8,"Full":"2020-07-08"},"EndDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":9,"Day":23,"Full":"2020-09-23"},"Synopsis":"Far in the future, the lifeforms known as Gadoll suddenly arose as a threat to humanity. The last surviving humans on Earth confine themselves to the Tank, a lower district in the giant mobile fortress Deca-Dence. While the Gears who live on the upper floors are warriors who go out to fight as part of the Power, most Tankers are content to provide support from the backlines, butchering Gadoll meat and reinforcing defenses. Natsume is among those who would rather go to the front lines; undeterred by her prosthetic right arm, she seeks to join the small number of Tanker soldiers who join the Gears in combat. \n\nBut despite her peers at the orphanage each receiving their work assignments, Natsume\u2019s enlistment to the Power remains unapproved. In the meantime, she begins a job as a cleaner in an armor repair team led by the hard-nosed and apathetic Kaburagi, who seems to be more than he lets on. Though initially cold to his idealistic subordinate, he soon recognizes in her the potential to upset the status quo of the world. As Natsume\u2019s new mentor, Kaburagi prepares her for the special and unique role as a game-changing bug in the system.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.36,"Rank":2330,"Popularity":786,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"23:30"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":25207,"Completed":152906,"OnHold":10643,"Dropped":21133,"PlanToWatch":86741,"Total":296630},"Favorites":895,"Producers":["AT-X","BS11","Kadokawa Media House","Kadokawa","NewGin"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Nut"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Theater of Life\u0022 by Konomi Suzuki (\u9234\u6728\u3053\u306E\u307F) (eps 2-11)"],"Endings":["\u0022Kioku no Hakobune (\u8A18\u61B6\u306E\u7BB1\u821F)\u0022 by Kashitarou Itou (\u4F0A\u6771\u6B4C\u8A5E\u592A\u90CE) (eps 2-12)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=14994","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:36:43.207+01:00"},{"Id":40057,"Title":"Akai Hana Shiroi Hana","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1246/101881.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1976,"Month":12,"Day":2,"Full":"1976-12-02"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1976-12-02"},"Synopsis":"Akai Hana Shiroi Hana was a song was originally created in 1970 and has been covered many times such as this minimalist Minna no Uta music video.

Arte, a delightful young lady from an aristocratic family, dreams of being an artist and contributing to the renewal of civilization. However, with her father\u0027s death, she ends up losing the only person who believed in her passion for art. Now she is expected to marry a nobleman and live as a refined housewife without disgracing her family name. Reluctant to accept her fate, the headstrong Arte steps into the streets in search of a master artisan to take her on as an apprentice.\n\nIn her quest for a mentor, Arte has to face harsh reality when she is completely shunned for being a female artist. No one believes that women are capable of fine craftsmanship, and therefore none are willing to accept her. Luckily, a renowned artisan by the name of Leo is persuaded to take her as his disciple since he has none anyway. And thus, Arte\u0027s new life begins, far from the comfort of her noble upbringing. As an apprentice, she must earn her keep while tackling various challenges along the difficult path to becoming a full-fledged, master artisan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.19,"Rank":3215,"Popularity":1693,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":80,"Name":"Visual Arts"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1451,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":10136,"Completed":65369,"OnHold":4755,"Dropped":8764,"PlanToWatch":39297,"Total":128321},"Favorites":361,"Producers":["MediaNet","Toei Video","KlockWorx","flying DOG","Nikkatsu","Asmik Ace","BS Fuji","NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","Tokyo MX","Glovision","North Stars Pictures","RAY","Muse Communication"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Seven Arcs"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Clover (\u30AF\u30ED\u30FC\u30D0\u30FC)\u0022 by Maaya Sakamoto"],"Endings":["\u0022Hare Moyou (\u6674\u308C\u6A21\u69D8)\u0022 by Kiyono Yasuno"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=15013","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T20:37:37.766+01:00"},{"Id":40129,"Title":"Rebirth","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1640/115820.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":1,"Day":5,"Full":"2020-01-05"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":6,"Day":23,"Full":"2021-06-23"},"Synopsis":"The series revolve around a team of 12 high school students who love to play the trading card game Rebirth For You.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":5.78,"Rank":10172,"Popularity":8697,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":11,"Name":"Strategy Game"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":48,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"01:00"},"Source":"Card Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":180,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":661,"Completed":576,"OnHold":239,"Dropped":758,"PlanToWatch":2145,"Total":4379},"Favorites":3,"Producers":["LIDENFILMS"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["LIDENFILMS Osaka Studio"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["1: \u0022Rebirth GO!

This good deed allows him to be reborn with all his memories in another world as Cain von Silford, the third son of a margrave.\n\nWhen Cain turns five, a baptismal ceremony in the church grants him an audience to the seven gods who preside over the world. Not only do the gods fill him in on the circumstances of his reincarnation, but they also give Cain their respective divine protections\u2014allowing him to use cheat-like abilities in swordsmanship, magic, and many other aspects.\n\nWith these blessings, Cain sets out to live a fulfilling life that he deems a dream come true. However, it soon becomes clear that the gods have more plans for him than just a haphazard bestowal of overwhelming power.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.68,"Rank":5952,"Popularity":1315,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"},{"Id":62,"Name":"Isekai"},{"Id":72,"Name":"Reincarnation"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":18560,"Completed":134560,"OnHold":2145,"Dropped":8738,"PlanToWatch":27532,"Total":191535},"Favorites":967,"Producers":["Nippon Columbia","Studio Mausu","Docomo Anime Store","BS11","Crunchyroll","Yomiuri TV Enterprise","Happinet Phantom Studios","Tohjak","Hifumi Shobo"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Magic Bus","EMT Squared"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Preview\u0022 by Aya Uchida"],"Endings":["\u0022\u4E03\u8272\u306E\u7D75\u306E\u5177\u3067\u0022 by 7land"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17552","LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:15:18.473+01:00"},{"Id":52610,"Title":"Asi Yu Xiao Liangdang","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/126571.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":7,"Day":22,"Full":"2020-07-22"},"EndDate":null,"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":19079,"Popularity":20679,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Currently Airing","NumEpisodes":null,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":90,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":51,"Completed":0,"OnHold":22,"Dropped":71,"PlanToWatch":89,"Total":233},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-02T01:15:20.918+01:00"},{"Id":52611,"Title":"Okashi na Tensei","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1251/136232.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":7,"Day":4,"Full":"2023-07-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":9,"Day":19,"Full":"2023-09-19"},"Synopsis":"When a genius patissier dies in a tragic accident before achieving his dream of creating the world\u0027s greatest sweets, he is reincarnated as nine-year-old Pastry Mille \u0022Pas\u0022 Morteln.

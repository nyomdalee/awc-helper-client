in Japan, underground golfer Eve wants nothing more than to play a match against Aoi Amawashi, the \u0022Innocent Tyrant\u0022 prodigy that caught her eye. However, the girls, wishing to finally settle the score on who is the better golfer, will have to wait until the conclusion of the All-Japan Girls\u0027 High School Gold Doubles Championship. Now competing together for the Raiou Girls\u0027 Academy\u0027s golf team, Eve and Aoi decide to work together to claim a win for their institution.\n\nFor a chance at defeating their more challenging opponents, both girls must find a way to further develop their golfing styles. However, dangerous figureheads pull strings in the background, making this high school golf tournament much more serious than it appears. In addition, Eve\u0027s illusive past resurfaces, making matters between her and Aoi even more complicated than they already were.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.61,"Rank":1420,"Popularity":3910,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"01:23"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":2901,"Completed":15011,"OnHold":541,"Dropped":554,"PlanToWatch":11981,"Total":30988},"Favorites":169,"Producers":["TV Tokyo"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Bandai Namco Pictures"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Venus Line\u0022 by Kohmi Hirose"],"Endings":["\u0022\u541B\u304C\u3044\u308B\u304B\u3089\u0022 by Sarasa Kadowaki"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17481","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T23:31:58.953+01:00"},{"Id":52230,"Title":"Blink in the Desert","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1753/124836.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":8,"Day":3,"Full":"2021-08-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021-08-03"},"Synopsis":"Malice comes up abruptly.

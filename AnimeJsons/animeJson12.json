Tokyo was bombed over a year later after the animals\u0027 slaughter and Ueno Zoo was never hit.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia and Wikipedia)","Mean":null,"Rank":16151,"Popularity":17057,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":4708,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":21,"Completed":199,"OnHold":9,"Dropped":94,"PlanToWatch":158,"Total":481},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Group TAC"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6386","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T16:46:17.412+01:00"},{"Id":11099,"Title":"Tiger \u0026 Bunny Pilot","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/30751.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":5,"Day":27,"Full":"2011-05-27"},"EndDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":5,"Day":27,"Full":"2011-05-27"},"Synopsis":"The pilot episode for Tiger \u0026 Bunny released on the first DVD \u0026 BD volume.","Mean":6.16,"Rank":8982,"Popularity":6682,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":31,"Name":"Super Power"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":133,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":193,"Completed":6427,"OnHold":114,"Dropped":136,"PlanToWatch":3220,"Total":10090},"Favorites":6,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Sunrise"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8101","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T16:46:19.609+01:00"},{"Id":11101,"Title":"Honoo no Alpenrose","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/30729.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1986,"Month":2,"Day":15,"Full":"1986-02-15"},"EndDate":{"Year":1986,"Month":3,"Day":31,"Full":"1986-03-31"},"Synopsis":"Two-part OVA that summarises the entire Honoo no Alpenrose TV series featuring a new dubbing and reworked scenes.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":6.17,"Rank":8951,"Popularity":13344,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":2,"StartSeason":{"Year":1986,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":4560,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":53,"Completed":649,"OnHold":25,"Dropped":86,"PlanToWatch":426,"Total":1239},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Tatsunoko Production"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Yume no Tsubasa: Alpen Rose (\u5922\u306E\u7FFC~\u30A2\u30EB\u30DA\u30F3\u30ED\u30FC\u30BC~)\u0022 by Konii"],"Endings":["\u0022Yancha na Angel (\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u306A\u30A8\u30F3\u30B8\u30A7\u30EB)\u0022 by Konii"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8559","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T16:46:21.389+01:00"},{"Id":11103,"Title":"Busou Shinki Moon Angel","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/37953.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":9,"Day":7,"Full":"2011-09-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":26,"Full":"2012-01-26"},"Synopsis":"The story follows the coming of age and Shinki battles of Tsubasa, a boy who dreams of becoming a Shinki Master, and his Shinki partner Arnval Mk. 2.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":6.53,"Rank":6835,"Popularity":5944,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":300,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":716,"Completed":7490,"OnHold":521,"Dropped":684,"PlanToWatch":4048,"Total":13459},"Favorites":5,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TNK","Kinema Citrus"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Labyrinth\u0022 by MIQ"],"Endings":["\u0022Kayowaki Juujika no Ai\u0022 by KEI"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8513","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T16:46:23.406+01:00"},{"Id":11111,"Title":"Another","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75509.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":10,"Full":"2012-01-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":3,"Day":27,"Full":"2012-03-27"},"Synopsis":"In class 3-3 of Yomiyama North Junior High, transfer student Kouichi Sakakibara makes his return after taking a sick leave for the first month of school.

Soon enough, his love for all things zombie comes in handy when his cat Baabu gets run over, prompting Chihiro to try to make a resurrection potion and bring him back to life. During his endeavor, he sees a rich girl named Rea Sanka yelling into an old well every day about her oppressive life. After meeting and bonding with her, Chihiro is convinced by Rea to persevere in saving Baabu. Eventually, he succeeds with the help of the poisonous hydrangea flowers from Rea\u0027s family garden.\n\nUnaware of the potion\u0027s success and seeking to escape the burdens of her life, Rea drinks the resurrection potion, mistakenly thinking she will die. Though it doesn\u0027t kill her, the effects still linger and her death from a fatal accident causes her to be reborn as a zombie. With help from Chihiro, Rea strives to adjust to her new\u2014albeit undead\u2014life. \n\nFor a boy wanting a zombie girlfriend, this situation would seem like a dream come true. But in Sankarea, Chihiro\u0027s life becomes stranger than usual as he deals with Rea\u0027s odd new cravings and the unforeseen consequences of her transformation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.27,"Rank":2961,"Popularity":359,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":14,"Name":"Horror"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"}],"Themes":[{"Id":64,"Name":"Love Polygon"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"01:55"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":29929,"Completed":420029,"OnHold":15764,"Dropped":18102,"PlanToWatch":149461,"Total":633285},"Favorites":2757,"Producers":["Lantis","Pony Canyon","TBS","Kodansha","BS-TBS"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Studio Deen"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Esoragoto (\u7D75\u7A7A\u4E8B)\u0022 by nano.RIPE"],"Endings":["\u0022Above your hand\u0022 by Annabel"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8642","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T16:49:05.47+01:00"},{"Id":11505,"Title":"Kiss Dum: Omokage","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/69105.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":9,"Day":29,"Full":"2011-09-29"},"EndDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":9,"Day":29,"Full":"2011-09-29"},"Synopsis":"Special included with the Blu-ray Box Set.

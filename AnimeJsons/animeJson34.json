An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner, wherein the law of gravity is briefly suspended while the character comes to realize their imminent doom.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":6.69,"Rank":5931,"Popularity":11745,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":78,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Unknown","StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":480,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":87,"Completed":1426,"OnHold":65,"Dropped":203,"PlanToWatch":269,"Total":2050},"Favorites":10,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TUBA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13584","LastUpdated":"2025-01-06T00:38:47.409+01:00"},{"Id":33431,"Title":"Vicky and Johnny","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1974/135549.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2007"},"EndDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2007"},"Synopsis":"The series follows Vicky and Johnny, two exuberant children who become involved in several boy vs. girl matches.","Mean":null,"Rank":14954,"Popularity":21296,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":104,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Unknown","StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":110,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":11,"Completed":94,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":42,"PlanToWatch":49,"Total":199},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TUBA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T05:51:20.913+01:00"},{"Id":33433,"Title":"Shuumatsu no Izetta","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82119.webp","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":10,"Day":1,"Full":"2016-10-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":12,"Day":17,"Full":"2016-12-17"},"Synopsis":"After Germania invaded a neighboring country in 1939, Europe spiraled into a devastating war.

With the spacecraft running dangerously low on resources, the survivors\u0027 leading council must decide on their path forward: should they continue to gamble on finding another Earth-like planet to inhabit, or take to heart an anonymous essay theorizing what may be the only weakness of the \u0022Godzilla,\u0022 who forced the last remnants of humanity off their home world?\n\nThe author of the controversial essay is Haruo Sakaki, a man who witnessed the death of his parents to Godzilla at a young age, which has led him to harbor an obsessive hatred for the monster. Now, he spearheads the operation aimed at reclaiming humanity\u0027s birthright from the king of monsters and slaying him once and for all. But, alongside humanity, Earth has undergone drastic change since their departure; Godzilla and its numerous spawns may pale in comparison to the darkness lurking within the hearts of this close-knit community of survivors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.43,"Rank":7496,"Popularity":2859,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":5265,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":1127,"Completed":48835,"OnHold":422,"Dropped":588,"PlanToWatch":14035,"Total":65007},"Favorites":68,"Producers":["TOHO","TOHO animation"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Polygon Pictures"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022WHITE OUT\u0022 by XAI"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=12315","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T05:58:26.474+01:00"},{"Id":33787,"Title":"Usamaru","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/81365.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":8,"Day":5,"Full":"2016-08-05"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":10,"Day":21,"Full":"2016-10-21"},"Synopsis":"Short adaptation of LINE rabbit sticker.","Mean":null,"Rank":14958,"Popularity":19115,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":300,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":20,"Completed":129,"OnHold":5,"Dropped":72,"PlanToWatch":100,"Total":326},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Craftar Studios"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Usamaru no Uta (\u3046\u3055\u307E\u308B\u306E\u3046\u305F)\u0022 by Aimi Yano (\u77E2\u91CE\u3042\u3044\u307F)"],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=12316","LastUpdated":"2025-01-06T00:38:53.542+01:00"},{"Id":33788,"Title":"Marginal#4: Kiss kara Tsukuru Big Bang","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/83799.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":1,"Day":12,"Full":"2017-01-12"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":3,"Day":30,"Full":"2017-03-30"},"Synopsis":"The freshly debuted idol group Marginal#4 dreams of delivering their kisses to the end of the galaxy.

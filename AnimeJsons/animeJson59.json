humanity was oppressed by mysterious foes known as the Celestial Hosts, five exceptional mages joined forces to defeat them. In fear that these formidable enemies would return, the five most powerful mages, known as the Magia Vander, built a magical dome and a tower to contain them. Since then, the five strongest mages of every generation are tasked with monitoring the dome from the top of the Wizard\u0027s Tower.\n\nInspired by this story, childhood friends Will Serfort and Elfaria Albis Serfort promised each other that they would climb to the top of the Wizard\u0027s Tower. However, now a sixth-year student at Regarden Magic Academy, Will\u0027s future looks bleak. Although Elfaria managed to join the ranks of the Magia Vander five years prior thanks to her unparalleled magical power, Will has no magical abilities whatsoever, attracting the ire of teachers and students alike.\n\nHowever, blessed with an exceptional physique, Will is able to slay monsters in the labyrinth and prevail against skilled magicians with the only aid of his sword and a few magical items. Determined to climb the Wizard\u0027s Tower at all cost, Will is determined to not let anyone or anything prevent him from keeping the promise he made to Elfaria.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.89,"Rank":844,"Popularity":970,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"16:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1425,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":54514,"Completed":152256,"OnHold":3534,"Dropped":6360,"PlanToWatch":47594,"Total":264258},"Favorites":1471,"Producers":["Lantis","TBS","Kodansha","Crunchyroll","Jinnan Studio","Bandai Namco Filmworks","Bandai Namco Music Live"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Actas","Bandai Namco Pictures"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Fire and Fear\u0022 by PENGUIN RESEARCH (eps 2-12)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Fire and Fear\u0022 by PENGUIN RESEARCH (eps 1)","2: \u0022Wistoria: Wand and Sword (Vocal ver.)\u0022 by Jun Futamata (eps 11)","3: \u0022Frozen (\u30D5\u30ED\u30FC\u30BA\u30F3)\u0022 by TRUE (eps 2-9,12)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=18482","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T18:09:01.277+01:00"},{"Id":58065,"Title":"Sekai wa Mada Hajimatte sura Inai","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/141308.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":4,"Day":17,"Full":"2020-04-17"},"EndDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":4,"Day":17,"Full":"2020-04-17"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Sekai wa Mada Hajimatte sura Inai by PinocchioP, featuring Hatsune Miku.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":22528,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":218,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":9,"Completed":105,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":6,"PlanToWatch":20,"Total":142},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T18:09:10.538+01:00"},{"Id":58066,"Title":"Sorairo Utility (TV)","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/146787.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2025,"Month":1,"Day":4,"Full":"2025-01-04"},"EndDate":null,"Synopsis":"High schooler Minami Aoba has no strengths or aspirations and worries that she will graduate as a mere \u0022villager A.\u0022 In search of her uniqueness, she comes across a golf driving range and is approached by the part-timer and genius golfer Haruka Akane.

Baki\u0027s friends and mentors also struggle with this new peaceful stasis, completing great feats of strength training with little enthusiasm.\n\nSoon, Japan is shaken by the reveal of a long-gestating science experiment that results in the successful cloning of legendary samurai Musashi Miyamoto. The famed warrior relishes in testing his strength against Baki and the other fighting icons of Tokyo, but he struggles to assimilate with the modern era. Miyamoto clings to his ancient ideals of honor and dueling to the death, a philosophy that clashes with the more tranquil present.\n\nAs the resurrected swordsman attempts to rise to the top of this unfamiliar society by cutting through Baki\u0027s friends, he finds himself on a collision course with the vengeful teenager.

cute would be an understatement; she is breathtaking in every single way, and she knows it. At school, she is fawned over by boys and girls alike, and she graciously welcomes it all as a natural reaction to her irresistible charm. That is, until she comes across Medaka Kuroiwa, the boy who is seemingly immune to her overwhelming charisma. She goes out of her way to talk to him and even dials her cuteness up a notch, but no matter what she tries, Mona cannot wipe the scowl off Kuroiwa\u0027s face.\n\nBacked into a corner, Mona is forced to use the most devastating weapon in her arsenal: her physical allure. Such drastic measures would leave other boys foaming at their mouths, but Kuroiwa remains unfazed by her attempts. Little does Mona know that the only reason Kuroiwa just barely abstains from succumbing to her charms is because he is training to be a monk and thus trying his best not to be held down by worldly pleasures. As Mona goes all out to entice Kuroiwa, she fails to realize that his unintentional chivalry might just make her fall for him instead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":4141,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":74,"Name":"Love Status Quo"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2025,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Watching":959,"Completed":0,"OnHold":134,"Dropped":25,"PlanToWatch":30777,"Total":31895},"Favorites":114,"Producers":["DMM pictures"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["SynergySP"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Ame Tokimeki Koi Moyou (\u96E8\u30C8\u30AD\u30E1\u30AD\u604B\u6A21\u69D8)\u0022 by Irohanihohetto Ayafubumi (\u3044\u308D\u306F\u306B\u307B\u3078\u3063\u3068 \u3042\u3084\u3075\u3076\u307F)"],"Endings":["\u0022Kyunapi (\u30AD\u30E5\u30F3\u30A2\u30D4)\u0022 by Kaori Maeda (\u524D\u7530\u4F73\u7E54\u91CC)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=18627","LastUpdated":"2025-01-03T18:33:59.945+01:00"},{"Id":58854,"Title":"Kinoko Inu","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1954/144622.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":10,"Day":3,"Full":"2024-10-03"},"EndDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":12,"Day":19,"Full":"2024-12-19"},"Synopsis":"Grief-stricken over the death of his last family member, his dog Hanako, picture book writer Hotaru Yuuyami suffers from writer\u0027s block for nearly two months.

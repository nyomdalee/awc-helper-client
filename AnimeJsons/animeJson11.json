The clan was known as the Manyuu, and the skill was the ability to administer a sword strike that could shrink the size of a woman\u0027s breasts. This might not seem like an ability that could exert power over a land, but in Manyuu Hikenchou, large breasts denote status, wealth, fame, and influence.\n\nGrave concern has arisen in the Manyuu clan due to the actions of their chosen successor, Chifusa. Disgusted with the breast obsessed society that the Manyuu have created and perpetuated, Chifusa has not only deserted the clan, but also stolen the sacred scroll that details their techniques to growing and severing breasts.\n\nFortunately, Chifusa is not completely alone. Her fellow warrior Kaede is sympathetic to her cause; a sympathy that could place her in considerable danger. Now wanted by the very clan that raised her, Chifusa must defend her life and Kaede\u0027s while seeking to undo the damage their brethren have done to the land. Along the way, Chifusa will discover that she harbors a power that goes far beyond the scope of her training, one that could help shape and change the land that she seeks to bring equality to.","Mean":6.19,"Rank":8270,"Popularity":2354,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":21,"Name":"Samurai"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"01:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Watching":6483,"Completed":31096,"OnHold":3042,"Dropped":4880,"PlanToWatch":33129,"Total":78630},"Favorites":268,"Producers":["TV Tokyo","Lantis","Enterbrain","Memory-Tech","Happinet Pictures"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Hoods Entertainment"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Unmei (\u904B\u547D)\u0022 by AiRI"],"Endings":["\u0022Futatsu no Ashiato (\u4E8C\u3064\u306E\u8DB3\u8DE1)\u0022 by AiRI"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8338","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T18:27:53.642+01:00"},{"Id":10466,"Title":"Phantom Yuusha Densetsu","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/28745.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1991,"Month":1,"Day":24,"Full":"1991-01-24"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1991-01-24"},"Synopsis":"Yazawa, a Japanese pilot, suffers a crash in his Phantom jetfighter.

In hopes of returning the furniture after attempting to stuff it in a corner of her tiny apartment, she calls her mother to complain about the sudden burden, but her mom only vaguely tells Noel that it is \u0022her turn.\u0022\n\nWhen Noel returns from a night of drinking, she finds a fat child in her apartment eating her food. Shocked and confused, she eventually discovers that her mother\u0027s wardrobe contains six strange children who claim to serve the current mistress of the Hiiragi family. Refusing to buy this blunt explanation, Noel struggles to adapt to her new lifestyle, wondering whether the children\u0027s service is a blessing or a curse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.75,"Rank":5294,"Popularity":7791,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1380,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":93,"Completed":4488,"OnHold":49,"Dropped":73,"PlanToWatch":1102,"Total":5805},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Production I.G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8143","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T18:28:18.968+01:00"},{"Id":10504,"Title":"Gosick: Utsukushiki Kaibutsu wa Konton no Sen wo Shimiru","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/28897.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":3,"Day":26,"Full":"2011-03-26"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2011-03-26"},"Synopsis":"Recap episode.

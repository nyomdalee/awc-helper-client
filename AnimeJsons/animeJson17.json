What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are

After three hundred million years, the snowy mountains where the Paleozoic Pok\u00E9mon once lived are no longer habitable\u2014but not all of the race are actually extinct. Several specimens are still alive and desperate to find a new place to call home. Led by a Shiny Genesect and accompanied by the Legendary Pok\u00E9mon Mewtwo, the vagabond creatures arrive in New Tork City.\n\nPerceiving the city skyline as similar to their initial habitat, the Genesect take over the city center, driving out other Pok\u00E9mon and threatening the existence of the local populace. On top of that, the Genesect leader confronts Mewtwo in a cunning, fast-paced duel that is bound to destroy the entire city\u2014and it\u0027s up to Satoshi and his companions to save the city and reconcile the feuding Pok\u00E9mon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":6.34,"Rank":7494,"Popularity":3097,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":4241,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":360,"Completed":42395,"OnHold":257,"Dropped":298,"PlanToWatch":4717,"Total":48027},"Favorites":10,"Producers":[],"Licensors":["The Pokemon Company International"],"Studios":["OLM"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Natsumeku Sakamichi (\u590F\u3081\u304F\u5742\u9053)\u0022 by Daisuke"],"Endings":["\u0022Egao (\u7B11\u9854)\u0022 by Ikimonogakari"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=9564","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T16:29:25.644+01:00"},{"Id":16690,"Title":"My Life","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/45008.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":11,"Day":10,"Full":"2012-11-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2012-11-10"},"Synopsis":"A high school girl, while pondering her future, sees it flash before her eyes.","Mean":6.24,"Rank":7995,"Popularity":8731,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":274,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":113,"Completed":2882,"OnHold":49,"Dropped":54,"PlanToWatch":1219,"Total":4317},"Favorites":5,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T16:29:26.756+01:00"},{"Id":16692,"Title":"Jigoku Youchien","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/49439.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":1,"Day":9,"Full":"2013-01-09"},"EndDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":3,"Day":26,"Full":"2013-03-26"},"Synopsis":"Flash anime shorts that center around a school for mischievous demon toddlers.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":4.55,"Rank":12811,"Popularity":11165,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":130,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":81,"Completed":1019,"OnHold":46,"Dropped":158,"PlanToWatch":602,"Total":1906},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Zekkyou\u2605Jigocremation (\u7D76\u53EB\u2605\u30B8\u30B4\u30AF\u30EA\u30E1\u30FC\u30B7\u30E7\u30F3)\u0022 by Succubu-chan and Cried Hell Corps (\u30B5\u30AD\u30E5\u30D0\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u3055\u3051\u3076\u5730\u7344\u968A) (Kana Asumi, Yuki Ono, Mariko Honda, Saeko Sougou)"],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T16:29:27.835+01:00"},{"Id":16694,"Title":"Sankarea: Wagahai mo...

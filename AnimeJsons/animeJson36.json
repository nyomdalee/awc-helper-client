The chick that hatches three days later has a long neck and quacks in an unfamiliar way. However, the mother duck is relieved to see the youngest duckling actively training to swim. Being different from other ducklings in appearance, he is mocked by dogs and bullied by frogs. He is despised by other ducks and ostracized by his four brothers. One evening, the youngest duckling leaves his mother and brothers. In autumn, the duckling who continues to travel alone asks a goose to let him join his flock. While they are talking, they see a hunter fire a gun and barely escape the hound. Autumn gives way to winter. The duckling is lying on a bed in a cabin near a second house on the lakeside. A black cat and a hen are watching the duckling with a concerned look. The duckling wakes up and is told by the black cat that he was saved while being attacked by a weasel. The hen says that the duckling does not look like a duck, and the black cat tells the duckling that he can stay as long as he wishes. Summer comes after the spring. Children in a second house spot a beautiful swan. The black cat tells the hen that he is proud of having raised the swan. The young swan\u0027s days are peaceful and happy.

Created to foster the next generation of theatrical talent, this girls\u0027 only school works to improve the singing, acting, and dancing skills of its students.\n\nOne student is 16-year-old Karen Aijou, an easygoing girl who has dreamed of performing on stage since she was a child. Her love for theater is further invigorated when her childhood friend Hikari Kagura transfers to Seishou Academy. Through her old friend, Karen stumbles upon a secret elevator leading to a massive theater underneath the school. Hosted by a talking giraffe, this arena serves as a battleground where her classmates participate in duels to determine who among them deserves the title of \u0022Top Star,\u0022 earning them the right to play one of the lead roles in Starlight. Emboldened by the promise she made with Hikari to someday be stars together, Karen enters these mysterious battles in the hopes of making their dream a reality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.66,"Rank":1378,"Popularity":2321,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"},{"Id":70,"Name":"Performing Arts"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"01:28"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1444,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":6778,"Completed":37444,"OnHold":3587,"Dropped":4307,"PlanToWatch":39332,"Total":91448},"Favorites":1555,"Producers":["Pony Canyon","TBS","Bushiroad","Overlap","Nelke Planning","APDREAM"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Kinema Citrus"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Hoshi no Dialogue (\u661F\u306E\u30C0\u30A4\u30A2\u30ED\u30FC\u30B0)\u0022 by Starlight Kukugumi (\u30B9\u30BF\u30A1\u30E9\u30A4\u30C8\u4E5D\u4E5D\u7D44) (eps 2-11)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Hoshi no Dialogue (\u661F\u306E\u30C0\u30A4\u30A2\u30ED\u30FC\u30B0)\u0022 by Starlight Kukugumi (\u30B9\u30BF\u30A1\u30E9\u30A4\u30C8\u4E5D\u4E5D\u7D44) (eps 1, 12)","2: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Hikari Kagura (Suzuko Mimori) (eps 3)","3: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Karen Aijou, Kagura Hikari (Momoyo Koyama, Suzuko Mimori) (eps 4)","4: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Mahiru Tsuyuzaki (Haruki Iwata) (eps 5)","5: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Futaba Isurugi, Kaoruko Hanayagi (Teru Ikuta, Ayasa Itou) (eps 6)","6: \u0022Fly Me to the Star (instrumental version)\u0022 (eps 7)","7: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Karen Aijou (Momoyo Koyama) (eps 8)","8: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Junna Hoshimi, Nana Daiba (Hinata Satou, Moeka Koizumi) (eps 9)","9: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Maya Tendou, Claudine Saijou (Maho Tomita, Aina Aiba) (eps 10)","10: \u0022Fly Me to the Star\u0022 by Maya Tendou, Junna Hoshimi, Mahiru Tsuyuzaki, Nana Daiba, Saijou Claudine, Futaba Isurugi, Kaoruko Hanayagi (Maho Tomita, Hinata Satou, Haruki Iwata, Moeka Koizumi, Aina Aiba, Teru Ikuta, Ayasa Itou) (eps 11)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13152","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T06:48:46.975+01:00"},{"Id":35504,"Title":"Velvet Underworld: Fragment Person","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/85579.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":7,"Day":18,"Full":"2009-07-18"},"EndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":4,"Day":1,"Full":"2010-04-01"},"Synopsis":"Music videos bundled with character CDs for the Velvet Underworld cast.","Mean":6.29,"Rank":null,"Popularity":15983,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":210,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":35,"Completed":177,"OnHold":15,"Dropped":41,"PlanToWatch":334,"Total":602},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["GARDEN LODGE"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T06:48:49.359+01:00"},{"Id":35505,"Title":"Velvet Underworld: Alternative","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/85581.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2007"},"EndDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2007"},"Synopsis":"A music video promoting the multi-media project Velvet Underworld.","Mean":5.69,"Rank":null,"Popularity":16817,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":192,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":25,"Completed":274,"OnHold":11,"Dropped":26,"PlanToWatch":167,"Total":503},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["GARDEN LODGE"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T06:48:51.967+01:00"},{"Id":35507,"Title":"Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86830.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":7,"Day":12,"Full":"2017-07-12"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":9,"Day":27,"Full":"2017-09-27"},"Synopsis":"On the surface, Koudo Ikusei Senior High School is a utopia.

At least, that is what Haruka Oozora learns on her first day in Okinawa after moving in with her grandmother and her cousin Kanata Higa. While touring a nearby beach, Haruka stumbles upon some girls practicing beach volleyball and is quickly invited to join. This friendly practice game suddenly turns into a match when one of the girls, Narumi Tooi, notices Kanata approaching the court.\n                \nAlthough the two suffer a devastating defeat, Haruka finally realizes the reason for her cousin\u2019s quiet and distant behavior. Kanata and Narumi used to be an exceptionally talented beach volleyball duo, until Kanata quit due to her short height causing problems for Narumi. Now, with the Junior Tournament just weeks away, Haruka must learn the intricacies of competitive beach volleyball and help Kanata overcome her crippling anxiety towards the sport that she once used to love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.65,"Rank":6136,"Popularity":1989,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"21:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":9312,"Completed":49243,"OnHold":4845,"Dropped":10674,"PlanToWatch":41365,"Total":115439},"Favorites":177,"Producers":["AT-X","Houbunsha","Docomo Anime Store","Kadokawa Media House","Kadokawa"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["C2C"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022FLY two BLUE\u0022 by Haruka Oozora (CV: Kana Yuuki), Kanata Higa (CV: Saki Miyashita) (eps 3-6, 8-11)","2: \u0022Mae wo Muite!

Ji Fa (King Wu of Zhou), assisted by his strategist Jiang Ziya, rallies an army to overthrow the tyrant and restore peace and order. Throughout the story, battles are waged between the kingdoms of Shang and Zhou, with both sides calling upon various supernatural beings \u2013 deities, immortals, demons, spirits, and humans with magical abilities \u2013 to aid them in the war. Yuanshi Tianzun bestows upon Jiang Ziya the Fengshen Bang, a list that empowers him to invest the gods of Heaven. The heroes of Zhou and some of their fallen enemies from Shang are eventually endowed with heavenly ranking and essentially elevated to their roles as gods, hence the title of the novel.\n\n(Source: Wiki)","Mean":4.9,"Rank":12474,"Popularity":15769,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":17,"Name":"Martial Arts"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1976,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":5453,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":38,"Completed":209,"OnHold":12,"Dropped":81,"PlanToWatch":147,"Total":487},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13092","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T19:23:32.332+01:00"},{"Id":35382,"Title":"Yuri!!! on Ice: Yuri Plisetsky GPF in Barcelona EX - Welcome to The Madness","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/85548.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":5,"Day":26,"Full":"2017-05-26"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2017-05-26"},"Synopsis":"In his exhibition performance for the Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final in Barcelona, 15-year-old Yuri Plisetsky seeks to defy his \u0022Russian Fairy\u0022 nickname by showing off wild new choreography, the likes of which have never been seen from him on the ice before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.97,"Rank":638,"Popularity":2261,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":152,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":1539,"Completed":56554,"OnHold":578,"Dropped":661,"PlanToWatch":23629,"Total":82961},"Favorites":273,"Producers":["Avex Pictures"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["MAPPA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=12012","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T19:23:32.771+01:00"},{"Id":35383,"Title":"Yousei Land Mukashibanashi","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85594.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":4,"Day":10,"Full":"2017-04-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":6,"Day":26,"Full":"2017-06-26"},"Synopsis":"A direct sequel to Forest Fairy Five.","Mean":4.59,"Rank":12789,"Popularity":13351,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"20:00"},"Source":"Picture Book","AverageEpisodeDuration":600,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":61,"Completed":430,"OnHold":26,"Dropped":135,"PlanToWatch":283,"Total":935},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13110","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T19:23:34.482+01:00"},{"Id":35385,"Title":"Yukai na Animal Bus 2nd Season","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85231.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":7,"Day":2,"Full":"2017-07-02"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":9,"Day":17,"Full":"2017-09-17"},"Synopsis":"Second season of Yukai na Animal Bus.","Mean":null,"Rank":14796,"Popularity":18417,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":80,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":15,"Completed":99,"OnHold":12,"Dropped":82,"PlanToWatch":71,"Total":279},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TMS Entertainment"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13111","LastUpdated":"2024-01-01T19:23:35.667+01:00"},{"Id":35386,"Title":"Tonpei to Sarukichi","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85236.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1932,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"1932"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"1932"},"Synopsis":"A lazy pig Tonpei steals food from the monkeys Sarukichi and assaults some of them.

In 2023, the bishoujo game industry is overrun with cheap, repetitive, and low-effort releases, with Blue Bell at the core of the problem.\n\nAfter stumbling upon a vintage game store and reminiscing about the impressive titles of the past, Konoha suddenly winds up in the year 1992\u2014just as the bishoujo game industry was beginning to flourish. Konoha struggles to accept her new circumstances until she joins Alcohol Soft, a small game company willing to employ her as an illustrator. Although she believes her skills from the future will propel her to success, technology and illustration are considerably old-school, and she must promptly adapt if she wishes to fulfill her dreams.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.9,"Rank":4771,"Popularity":3083,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":69,"Name":"Otaku Culture"},{"Id":78,"Name":"Time Travel"},{"Id":48,"Name":"Workplace"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Thursday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":6505,"Completed":26612,"OnHold":1823,"Dropped":3860,"PlanToWatch":17386,"Total":56186},"Favorites":236,"Producers":["Aniplex","Tokyo MX","BS11","Contents Seed"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Silver"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u002265535\u0022 by Shoko Nakagawa"],"Endings":["1: \u002265535\u0022 by Shoko Nakagawa (eps 1, 13)","2: \u0022Link ~past and future~ (\u30EA\u30F3\u30AF\uFF5Epast and future\uFF5E)\u0022 by Konoha Akisato (CV: Aoi Koga) (eps 2-12)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17802","LastUpdated":"2025-01-01T03:04:53.606+01:00"},{"Id":54042,"Title":"Fate/Grand Order: Fujimaru Ritsuka wa Wakaranai","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1800/132226.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":2,"Day":4,"Full":"2023-02-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":7,"Day":30,"Full":"2023-07-30"},"Synopsis":"Ritsuka Fujimaru\u2014humanity\u0027s last master.

With her long silver hair, mesmerizing blue eyes, and exceptionally fair skin, she has captured the hearts of countless male students while being highly admired by all others. Even so, due to her seemingly unapproachable persona, everyone remains wary around the near-flawless girl.\n\nOne of the few exceptions is Alisa\u0027s benchmate Masachika Kuze, a relatively average boy who spends his days watching anime and playing gacha games. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, Masachika is the sole student to receive Alisa\u0027s attention. Unable to be fully honest, Alisa is frequently harsh on Masachika and only expresses her affection in Russian. Unbeknownst to her, however, Masachika actually understands the language yet simply pretends otherwise for his own amusement.\n\nAs the odd pair continues to exchange witty and playful remarks, their relationship gradually grows more romantic and delightful\u2014and Alisa might finally learn to freely convey her true feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":3345,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":null,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":41893,"Total":41893},"Favorites":657,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Doga Kobo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17914","LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T15:23:59.651+01:00"},{"Id":54745,"Title":"Twisted-Wonderland 3-shuunen Kinen PV","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1854/134331.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":3,"Day":17,"Full":"2023-03-17"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2023-03-17"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":6.41,"Rank":null,"Popularity":14498,"Genres":[{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"PV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":100,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":32,"Completed":390,"OnHold":9,"Dropped":26,"PlanToWatch":212,"Total":669},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["CloverWorks"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2024-01-02T15:24:01.154+01:00"},{"Id":54746,"Title":"Terrarium Adventure","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1127/136233.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":5,"Day":31,"Full":"2023-05-31"},"EndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":6,"Day":2,"Full":"2023-06-02"},"Synopsis":"\u0022I\u0027m a zillionaire in a gacha game!\u0022\nObsessed with the clicker game Infinite Diamonds for over a year, Jaehee finally reaches the ultimate in-game achievement \u2014 only to suddenly find herself in the RPG gacha game Terrarium Adventure!

In a twist of fate, at five years of age, Eumiella recalls memories of her past life in Japan. Uninterested in the romance aspect of the original game, she begins to dedicate herself to training her rare dark-type magic.\n\nDespite this, Eumiella\u0027s goals are clear: avoid becoming the hidden boss and stay out of the limelight. Upon entering the magic academy, however, she shakes the foundation of the kingdom when her level 99 status comes to light.
